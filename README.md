# NLP 2020/21 course project:
Offensive language exploratory analysis
- First submission: in the report we have written an introduction into our project, we looked at the related works in this field and we discussed our initial idea for the project.

- Second submission: in our second report we described what we did in between the first and second submission, we also discussed what we will do in the final stages of our project.

- Third and final submission: in our final submission we briefly described what we did to transfer our model to Slovene. We also added what was expected of us from the feedback: dataset descriptions, number of features, POS vs. TF-IDF.
