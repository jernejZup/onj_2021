This is a BERT based language classificator. In our project we used it classify offensive&hateful and neither speech. To train it we used Slovenian tweets.

To train it you only need torch and BERT both can be installed with a simple pip command:

pip install tensorflow

pip install BERT

We also provided a 10 epoch trained model: BERT_twitter_0010_0.7253.h5
