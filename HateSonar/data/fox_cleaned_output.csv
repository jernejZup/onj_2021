Merkel would never say NO
Expect more and more women to be asking .. "why are men no longer interested in me"! We're not going touch you until you pull our pants down!
Groping people in public wasn't already illegal? What's up with that, Deutschland?
Merkel, possible the only person in charge who is worse than what we have. Obama is trying his hardest though to get to Merkel's level. "A 21-year-old Iraqi man was convicted of sexual assault and given a one-year suspended sentence. A 26-year-old Algerian man was convicted of abetting a sexual assault and attempted assault, and given the same sentence." Sounds exactly like how Obama is trying to let all of the black people in this country get away with everything.
They know very well, no means NO! They need to pass a law making it legal to castrate those animals.
look like merkel just want to get laid
" but criticized two measures in the bill that could see people who aren't directly involved in the assault punished and foreigners deported for sexual harassment" Sounds like some German Legislators have the same mental disease the Democrats and Republicans who opposed Kate's Law had. Deporting people who are not citizens for acting like savages - how cruel!! (sarcasm)
She said "GO", not "NO" ~ ~ Slime ball Lawyers everywhere.
So, how many sexual assaults would there be if Muslims were burned in ovens?
Probably a lot less. What's your point?
In true liberal fashion, an ordinance that no means no, was passed. That will end all rapes by muslimes in Fatherland.
The Russians raped millions of German women and children at the end of WWII. Now the German people have to contend with this bunch of savages? How pathetic is it that a country has to cow-tow to a hoard of uncivilized migrants. Take your country back Germany.
Great, now lets have a talk with Africa.
Imagine that, Muslims are the problem...?
A one-year suspended sentence? Wow. That's really harsh.
Even though the woman was lying about the whole thing....LOL
You mean all 50?
This will work great, just like the bracelets they handed out that said don't touch me. Liebrals will never learn. hahahahahahaha
Just say "No." Yeah that'll stop those nasty rapists, especially the Muslims.
How does one say "NO" in Arabic ?
No idea, but an M16A4 will translate any language into Arabic.
GLOCK
Women aren't allowed to say "NO" in arab countries.
7.62 x 39 mm
I think it sounds the same as an M4 bolt chambering a round.
My Lilly Esin once in a blue moon got a new choice of the crop Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Coupe by unavailable off of a laptop... Flash it out.
That's it pass more laws, you know cause paper and ink prevents crime.
Ignorant troll. No one said the new law will prevent crime, just that it will make it easier to prosecute criminals --- which is a good thing.
no habla deutch.... No means white chicks want you more in Arabic mongrelland German politicians that approved of the refugee invaders are responsible for each and every crime committed by these mongrels! German citizens should kick all politicians and refugee invaders OUT!.
German citizens elected Merkel, who LOVES Muslims - and until German citizens take their country back, they are responsible for what happens.
is she related to BroBama ?
when no doesn't work...it is advisable to have some way to protect yourself
How about very sharp, steel tipped shoes. Give the sand monkey several hard kicks in the groin and it will know the meaning of "NEIN" !
don't think so because these muzzieazzholes are battle-hardened, decades of being kicked by sheep and goats made them numb
A really sharp knife and it will only happen once ...............
Germany, another of those wonderful liberal socialist countries where citizens can't carry guns...
Imagine that, Muslims are the problem...?
Merkels legacy. soon to come to your city.
We're armed, Rufus!
Do you really need a law to establish that no means no? Apparently so. Humanity has reached a sad state.
STUPID Politicians seeking relevancy to the stupid sheeple!
Learn to read. Previous law required a victim to put up a physical struggle before the rapist could be prosecuted.. The new law only requires her to say "no".
So if they are alone who has to prove it was said?
Government is the impossibility of reason........... Platoon
The Germans invited this filth into their once-great nation by electing Merkel -- and handed law and order over to the EU bureaucrats in Brussels. Now they are too timid to take their country back.
Until the whole world recognizes Islam for what it is, HATE SPEECH, this type of barbarism will only go on. The Muslims feel it is their right to obey only the laws that they agree with. Sexist attitudes against women are a core belief of Islam.
If Islam was only hate speech, they wouldn't be a problem, just an annoyance. Unfortunately Islam preaches, teaches, demands, applauds and rewards violent behavior. That is much worse than speech.
If it's not written in Sharia law (and it's NOT) then they (Muslims) ultimately won't care.
It's a shame that you have no idea what you are talking about.
Why are liberals always against deporting foreign criminals? They must support their crimes, I guess.
Liberal elites -- insulated from these crimes -- don't care if we get hurt, just so they can feel all tolerant and all.
Liberals are always pandering for votes from criminals.
The only thing musIims understand clearly is a good azzkicking.
The law wasnt the problem, its the rapist members of a peaceful religion.
neuter rapists
Yes please.
That includes Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby!
The Germans better realize real quick that you can't put a "no means no" law in sharia law.
How about "Just say no more muslims" ?
You can expel the Muslims too. That's the problem. They don't care about your laws.
Of course no means no. But not to a mooh-slum. Germany allowed these terrorist into their country, now live with it.
I get the impression that the German people really didn't have much of a say in it. Just another of example of Merkel/Obama progressivness.
No say? They elected Merkel, in large numbers.
No the people didn't the LOUSY LEADER DID, just like ODUMBO IS DOING HERE!
There is no law that will civilize the uncivilized.
So Americans will never improve then..
This law will work: God made everyone, Samuel Colt made them all equal.
Except in Germany, where Colt, Browning, Luger, et al. are not allowed to practice their function.
Yes there is, it's called capital punishment.
The problem was never the law or lack of a law, it was the immigrants the politicians let into the country.
And its the reason-one of them anyway that some Muzlim countries do not even allow one of these scumbags into their country. NOT ONE! They knew what would happen with these uncivilized animals and what they would do and they did exactly that to the women -young girls- and even have raped men. They should never be allowed out of their sand boxes.
That just isn't going to work. How many different languages do German women need to learn to say "no" in? I'd assume Arabic would be a key one.
hot high speed lead is an international language
They should allow the German women weapons to protect themselves.
Or......fathers, brothers, cousins of the women should protect them. How about that?
Sounds like Islam...a woman cannot leave her house unless accompanied by a male relative.
Then let them get raped. I don't really care. Go near one of the women in my family though. Different story.
If in an Islamic country the raped woman is considered to have dishonored her family and subject to beatings by her family if not subjected to an "honor killing".
Add to that....if they do protect the women--there should be no prosecution for them for what they do to these scumbags.
This is a religion that condones the treating of women as chattel. You let them into your country. What did you expect??
Saying "no" does not stop rapists. Keeping droves of men with "raping" mentality out of the country and arming people for self defense will help curb the rapes.
You can make all the laws you want. They won't control savages. You can dress an animal up like a man; it doesn't make it a man.
See NFL
if u have a job...do it right. they are in demand now and we don't need blackasses acting like monkeys. GIT ur ACT TOGETHER.
"No" should have always meant no. Just enforce laws and stop procrastinating and avoiding doing your job !!
And this is the vaunted "European Society" America's liberals want us to emulate?
Feel the bern
Bernie can feel himself, thank you.
doesn't remember where it is..
"On Thursday, a local court in Cologne handed down the first conviction for a sexual offense on New Year's Eve. A 21-year-old Iraqi man was convicted of sexual assault and given a one-year suspended sentence. A 26-year-old Algerian man was convicted of abetting a sexual assault and attempted assault, and given the same sentence." That is some aggressive sentencing there, I am absolutely certain that will deter such behavior from them in the future.
This would be a very reasonable sentence if it had one caveat, namely, boiling these subhuman scumbags in pig blood.
It's about time! Good lord!
Instead of passing these silly laws, just get rid of the sand knee grows
???
we need to dig him up
Merkel let these slugs in for the sake of 'humanity' with zero vetting. How about protecting your own citizens for a change?
Merkel is a human failure in every sense.
In the US, gun control is not the answer...BLACK control is the ANSWER.
Too things I hate the most. Hoplophobes and Racists.
"Too?". Better add grammar checkers to your list.
what's a hoplophobe? someone that hates bunnies?
I am all for gun control - use both hands, aim center mass, squeeze slowly.
Another civilized country being destroyed by brown invaders.
Hundreds of women were raped and molested in the New Year's Eve travesty. And only ONE conviction so far? This only became a problem when Germany opened its borders to hordes of women-hating Muslims.
And he was given a one year, suspended sentence. Hardly a deterrent.
Hard to punish a people that view women as their toys. Their religion allows this.
It's not a religion. It's a cult of hate, death and destruction.
Agreed
first immigrate them, then seduce them and then get them into acts where they dont want to hear NO. And then get them to jail if they are not submissive.
nice, but it doesn't help these women who were physically assaulted.
The great German nation brought this on itself. And its citizens pay the price for letting barbarians in unchecked.
Why do they keep Merkel in office. The woman is a disaster for Germany. She knows nothing and does everything to hurt her country
She sounds like Hillary.
And Oblama
but barry loves her...
Let me wrap my mind around this. A woman was raped by two men and a video shows her saying no and now she's on trial?? Yeah, we need European style justice here in America. And let me venture a guess. The opposition to the change that will allow deportation of these savages is the liberal wing of the equivalent to our own Democratic Party.
In this case, the liberal wing you're referring to is in Brussels.
And people wonder why England voted FOR Brexit?
hasent no been on the books forever
But it has never been defined. /sarc
depends on what the meaning of "is" - 'is".
Huh???
Now we have reverse discrimination, BIG TIME because of this PERCEIVED PROBLEM that our DEAR LEADER intended to remedy by EXECUTIVE FIAT! Just another reason why there should not be a federal department of education that doles out OUR OWN TAX MONEY and makes the states JUMP THROUGH HOOPS TO GET IT! Don't you think ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
Transgender people have existed since the beginning of time. Some have just always kept the fact that they felt they were the wrong gender a secret and suffered in silence. Others actually lived as the other gender often after moving to a new location. Obviously they used the bathroom of the gender they were living as and no one knew, because unlike Christian Conservatives they didn't go into bathrooms or dressing areas flailing their gen italia around. But now that it's 2016, all of a sudden it's a problem. Why? Politics. And the awareness that these people exist.
but CHRISTIANS are the only reason why you care about gays or tgs you want them in all of our churches . of have us pay a huge fine right? that is your equal rights
Think for yourself for once.
I always do there is no bigger lie than equal rights for all
You're becoming far too repetitive.
you never do that Sharon?
Honestly, who is Sharon? I don't get the joke.
so far thats you
You think my name is Sharon? OK?
glad you told us your name
Seeing as that's not my name, nor did I ever say it was, I still have no idea what you're trying to say.
you just now said it was
Well no, I didn't. So again, what in the world are you saying?
its nice to know your real name. its a pretty female name
Ah, okay. You wish I was a woman. That's cr⁠e⁠epy, Wayne. Keep your fan⁠tas⁠ies to yourself.
so you admit being a woman?
You've made it quite clear you're hoping I'm a woman. That's sa⁠d, Wayne. You need help.
I came back to my post and saw "16 replies" and actually thought "Wow, maybe my post generated some interesting conversation." Then I clicked on it. OMG. Sharon was probably his third wife...and second daughter.
Nah, he didn't come up with that one himself either.@cuss did and he's been parroting it. Like I said, he's not capable of an original thought.
He's not capable of any thought, period!
none that is a vote for Hilary
Republicans en masse are getting ready to turn their back on Trump the way they did on Bob Dole in '96 when it was clear he couldn't win against Bill Clinton.
no the opposite your polls poll mostly Democrats who can't stand Hilary who matters because of that cigar
The polls are accurate Wayne. Pollsters compete with each other for contracts and as a result focus on accuracy. They have no problem predicting elections within the margin of error. A couple like Fox and Rasmussen have a Republican house effect of around 3 points. A couple like PPP have a Dem house effect of around 3. The polls say Trump isn't doing very well. Worse than they said McCain and Romney were doing at this same time. EVEN Fox's polls.
why does that Neke Silver say that Trump will win by 57 percent?? they can easily find Democrats in Manhattans. but they don't like Hilary at all not many do
If Trump ever endorses violence against liberals, I will comply with his wishes, gladly.
I think we all will come Nov 8
This is why you need help. You need to be in asylum before you hurt someone.
you do since I thought you did not like HRC that is a lie obviously
Hopefully the authorities come for you before election day.
The latest projections are the Orange Clown loses in a landslide.
Here's hoping he brings as many Republicans down with him as possible.
nope the Dems will dump Hilary like they dumped Carter in 80
Source?
They dumped Carter because he couldn't resolve the hostage crisis and inflation was out of control...after he was in office four years. Now why are they going to dump Hillary?
His overlords haven't told him that one yet.
See what I mean? No answer, just repetition of the original statement.
nope a VOTE for hilary is what your only answer would be
No, any answer to the question would be a fine answer.
nope because the Dems rejected Carter and will do the same to Hilary. they want no more four years of Monica Lewinski
Monica Lewinski lol.
why not? she is why Hilary matters
Liberals can't distinguish men from women. Nor do they want to.
Cons can't distinguish morality from the rantings of a barbaric ancient middle eastern desert tribe.
and liberals use that same book and blast Christians day and night falsely
Freedomscout thinks the public schools are like Pink Floyd's The Wall.
I wish he'd publish his book already and stop spamming here.
and the left wants homeschooling banned. :)
Not me.
He's just spouting off the nonsense he hears on TV. He's not capable of critical thought.
Or it was conservative talk radio. A caller into Han nity says it and Han nity says "Oh you're right. You're right." And then they run around to friends and family wringing their hands as the repeat it as fact.
Given small handful of names that appear in Wayne's tweets, it's definitely FOX.
I know SB (sharon) does
I would like to see the quote.
Don't hold your breath.
just replied to me below. Read it if you dare. It's so sad.
I don't bother reading his posts. Everything coming from a creationist is nonsense.
I wonder which of your favorite talking heads just said that on TV.
I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?
The ones harmed the most are the children who are taught in government schooling that "transgenderism" is a valid description of a true reality. First, the very fact that "transgenderism" is not a true reality in itself but a condition of mind makes the claim of validity false...thus being deceptive for the children, youth, adolescents and adults who are deceived by it. Deception about anything critically important in the learning, growth, self-understanding and self-appreciation, and view of the civil society is evil and must be refused and refuted. To confuse children and youth, especially on the issues of their own nature is inexcusable and abusive to them. Because the falsehoods regarding "transgenderism" are being foisted on the culture by intention and willing complicity, the evil effects are widespread and become repeated in social media of all kinds.The result for stability of family and civil society is degradation of both.
Seriously, your denial of transgenderism as a "real thing" is quite dangerous as is the condemnation of anyone who is struggli g with identity issues because they are born that way or develop differently due to hormones and biology.
Transgenderism is just that, an "ism", meaning it is a condition of mind not based on reality. So when I say "real thing" I'm referring to the reality that such a person is confused because they think in their minds they are something which they are not in reality. Condemnation of such confused people isn't appropriate though either, precisely because they are confused and their inner motivations which bring on that confusion are something they don't understand themselves.
"Trangenderism" is real. Does it mean someone's gender has actually changed? No, but that doesn't make it less real. You mention evil effects. What are they? Be specific, not just something like it's evil or wrong.
To call some confusion of mind "real" distorts the discussion, as I tried to make clear that the confusion phenomena is real, i.e. that the person is really confused. So what is real is in opposition to what the confused person believes is real. When I refer to "evil" effects, I'm not using the term generically very often but to indicate a moral form of something that is inherently evil. However, I suspect you are looking for the human consequences that are harmful to the subject (victim) and to families and civil society. Is that the case?
Either way. Yes, how does it harm the individual and society? And, generically, what makes it inherently evil?
The harm to the person who is confused about their own sexuality should be obvious, but sadly political correctness has suppressed much of the truth about it. On the face of it, it's inherently harmful for a person to be confused about anything where reality is involved, because the confusion causes them to react to reality erroneously, making decisions that are, at least, not in their best interest and that are, at worst, very harmful to their lives and wellbeing.
How will you go about "curing" them? They have tried many different kinds of therapy with them. The only best solution for now is to help them transition. Forcing them to be "normal" will have them end up in depression, various problems and possibly suicide.
Also they are not "confused" as they are well aware of their own bodies.
There is a common misconception that one can somehow "force" a confused person out of their confusion. That seldom works, although there are some conditions where various forms of coercion may be effective...and may raise ethical concerns.Transgenderism, like all of the other sexual confusions and perversions, is inherently depressive to the individual, with other inner self harmful effects also...sometimes resulting in suicide. These are all very sad effects and consequences...and need core inner remedies not pandering, sheltering or accommodating. These confusions and perversions are inherently mental, not sourced in the physical nature itself...speaking generally and referring to the great majority of cases. The problem with most of psychology is that it categorizes "mental" as physical, of the brain, instead of the "mind". That's why secular psychology has no answers for these conditions, as permanent correction of the core cause. However, well versed psychologists and counselors who understand the mind as being part of the core spirit nature of the human being, human person, treat the person very differently, with an understanding of volition which dynamically changes the process of treatment and dynamically results in core therapy and lasting benefit, true healing of the person to live normally as they truly are in harmony with their physical self.
Again you have not given any viable solution. The "spiritual counseling" have been done many times before. The depression comes from the fact that people like you will not accept them as who they are and instead want to force them to conform to what is your idea of reality.
The depression doesn't come from outside for these persons, but from their inner confusion about their own nature and value. It can be accentuated by outside influence that is demeaning, of course. But the depression source is internal to the person themselves, and is alleviated when they come to understand some core concepts about their nature as human persons as well as their physical nature. I suppose that what you conceive as "spiritual counselling" is simplistic recitation of Scripture and platitudes, along with sessions of prayer, etc. What I'm actually referring to is very deep counseling, working inward from the objective self-concepts of the person as God's created being of immense worth and value, to both God and the rest of humanity. But the subject does not easily acclimate to these concepts when they are so confused. It takes a great deal of patience and explanation on various levels of understanding that fit the subject's own initial perceptions and beliefs, helping them to understand where they are in error in their concepts and understanding...and why their understanding is erroneous. Essential in this process is the understanding imparted to the subject that they can choose to believe differently, and choose to redirect their own thinking patterns, actually modifying their brain structure over time. The resulting symbiosis between purposed thought and changes in the brain result in true long lasting, permanent, healing.
Seems like general statements again. What is so obviously wrong or evil about it. What actual harm is being caused by their choices?
"Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last." - Luke 13:30 Guess who will be last in heaven?
No one?
No one as in nobody is answering or no one as in nobody is going to be last in heaven despite what Jesus said?
No one, as in my guess is no one.
I will be last if you just need someone to close up shop. Does room service exist in Heavan? I hope it is a fun place and not just a bunch of religious nuts praying and such.
Oh it's going to be a fun place all right. So, as Jesus said earlier in this chapter, " “Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to."
So you think it's moral to discriminate against transgender people when science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate? On what basis?
Here we see a rationale commonly used by those who support these bizarre behaviors and policies. First, the terms "discriminate" and "discrimination" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony, as though they were ultimate weapons of warfare against those who oppose these foolish notions. The idea is to intimidate the opposition with these terms to make them feel guilty of some wrong or evil, or at least make them feel unaccepted for who they are in their politically incorrect belief. Then these supporters of fallacy use a blatant fallacy to try to further intimidate any opposition...as in this case making the outrageously fallacious claim, "science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate". This is supposed intimidate the realists by putting them on the defensive, as though it was their job to refute the grand fallacy, instead of the promoter of the fallacy's job to defend it. Then, the tactic includes a question, which is supposed to imply that the writer is open minded rather than dogmatic and doctrinaire, which they are. Also the question is usually very open ended so that the answer will not like refute anything the writer has claimed, thus diverting attention from the utter fallacy and attempted intimidation to "put the monkey" on the back of the opposition. The way to refute these tactics is to speak the truth, even if it is simply put without a lot of facts and figures and arguments...the simple truth. Of course, one can also engage in presentation of facts, figures and arguments which help other readers/listeners learn the deeper proofs for the truth. So, the truth here is that it is righteous to discriminate between righteousness and evil, right and wrong, good and bad, and tell the truth about it. And the truth is that sexual confusions and perversions are a great harm to their subjects and our civil society if tolerated instead of dealt with properly with the Loving Righteousness of God.
How will it harm our "civil society"? Be specific, now.
Did you not understand the question?
I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?
I think he's stumped on that one.
Seems so.
First, the terms "discriminate" and "discrimination" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony – Freedomscout "Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last." - Luke 13:30 "Do to others as you would have them do to you." - Luke 6:31 Freedomscout, you need to heed to Jesus' words about how you treat other people.
I try to live by that "Do unto others" bit.
which "other people?" that has a hidden meaning and means HOMOSEXUALS. we see that the left faith ISLAM never had to be kind to "others" in Orlando did they? it depends a LOT on the religion. we watched while 102 "others" got shot in a bar yet we get sued over a cake! that VERY selective morality would make Jesus angry.
Of all the sick moves Obama has made, this has to be the top! He seems to think that as president, the people MUST sereve HIM, not that he should be serving the PEOPLE. The only people he seems to feel obligated to serve are those without morals, which he apparently feels he is part of! Even though he only has a few months left in his term, the house and senate should be calling themselves back into session and impeaching him! Under Obama and Clinton this country has become an immoral, dirtier than dirt nation! I suggest he send his children to a public school affected by this despotic rule! Just to show us how much he believes it!
So you think it's moral to discriminate against transgender people when science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate? On what basis?
So you think it is fine to protect the rights of immoral people while taking the rights from innocent women to have their privacy?
people? Who?
that is who.
If you don't understand what transgender is, go talk to your family doctor. They cover it in medical school.
I understand completely who they are. You are the one that has bought into the lie that they were born with some genetic defect. Transgender is a sick perversion.
Transgenders are immoral? That's news to me. I personally know two and they're not immoral.
Like your morals don't fall into question by supporting this.
Why should they?
Simply because people like you are out to change what is considered moral into something that isn't.
By whose definition? Yours only?
No by the standard that has been around since this country was founded and before.
No by the standard that has been around since this country was founded and before. So I guess you think we should still have sla very? I'm not surprised. It's biblical too.
Nice tactic to switch the conversation.
I'm just identifying exactly where your so called morals are coming from.
Not hardly.
Oh really? Then where?
Your interpretation of the Bible is flawed so making you understand anything from it will never happen until you recognize your need for a savior.
So you admit it. Your morality is coming from the bible and not science or medicine. Thank you for making my point.
So his morality is based on what was prevalent in the Middle East about 2000 years ago. Nothing like keeping up to date, eh?
Notice how she took off when it came down to actually having to defend God's Word.
Yep!
its where YOURS comes from too the Bible is why you push TG and gays its a lot more than a book
Deuteronomy 22:28 If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and r@pes her and they are discovered, 29 he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.
Leviticus 25:44 “‘Your male and female sla ves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy sla ves. 45 You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. 46 You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them sla ves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.
JEWISH LAWS they don't do that. but you care about the return of slavery via gay marriage
Exodus 21:20 “Anyone who beats their male or female sla ve with a rod must be punished if the sla ve dies as a direct result, 21 but they are not to be punished if the sla ve recovers after a day or two, since the sla ve is their property.
your faith ISLAM is far worse toward slaves than we are
Where do they come from, then?
Like your morals don't fall into question by getting your info about human se xuality and gender identity from a barbaric ancient middle eastern desert tribe that had no problem with adults marrying children and thought the appropriate way to deal with ra pe was to make the ra pist marry the victim.
Or stone the victim.
like Muslims do already
Discriminate against them in what way?
By telling them they can't use the bathroom or facilities of the gender that they're living as and under medical and mental health guidance to live as...as they have been for decades.
someone use the bathroom of their actual gender is not discrimination. A man who identifies as a woman (or vice versa) does not mean he is a woman.
Except that that's not their actual gender. They're the gender they're living as.
is not a choice. You're born male or female. It doesn't change because you think your the opposite.
It's "you're," You write like a fifth-grader. And sound like one as well.
Good job, you caught a typo to point out since you don't have a counter argument.
It wasn't a typo. You don't know the difference.
That doesn't make sense. If I know the difference between the two words, but used the wrong one, that is a typo. This isn't a college paper, I'm not proofreading or checking for auto correct issues. Again, I notice no counter argument from you on the actual post though.
How can I possibly make an understandable counter argument to someone that doesn't know the difference between "your" and "you're"? I just can't du﻿m﻿b it down enough.
And you can't understand a typo. Or just hide behind that claim since you can't argue the point, which is more likely in this case.
Ha ha!!
Ask your family doctor about it. They'll explain it to you.
It's pretty simple. A woman does not change into a man by thinking it. She is still a woman. No issue with her thinking/acting like a man, but that isn't what she is, physically.
join Islam SHOOT the TGs/gays problem solved they get to discriminate against whoever they want to
?
No answer huh? there is no way you are for equal rights
no answer? You didn't ask a question.
I did make a statement. I admit that
ITS PERFECTLY OKAY DEPENDING ON THE RELIGION the liberal faith militant Islam gets to shoot all the TG/s gays it wants to and be protected under Sharia Law
While I empathize with the sentiment and agree that Obama's motives are evil, the long standing evil of murderous abortion has been a terrible part of the moral decadence in America for 43 years now. But even that has been a symptom of the inner decay in the lives of so many people who have lost the moral compass that used to guide our culture.
The added confusion this is all bringing to children, youth, adolescents and young adults is tragic and so unnecessary. Parents are having a very difficult time shielding their children from the foolish influences of our culture that is creating so much uncertainty and relativism in the minds of youth...largely through social media and sadly through government schooling.
- The confusion is added by people following an ancient mythology that have no respect for science, medicine and psychology.
How does that have anything to do with it?
Religion poisons the minds of children against logic and truth.
Many religions are poisonous to logic and truth, that much is true...and human beings still remain fallen human beings even they are Redeemed by the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ. So there's that. But the fallacies of thinking cannot be limited or attributed to religion but to error inherent in human motivation, the motivation to utter self-centeredness as fallen sinful human beings. Nearly all of the world's many religions are expressions of that utter sinful nature...Christianity and Judaism being the sole exceptions.
Your comment was correct...except for the last seven words.
I stand by all of them.
Sure you do. And you look like a fo﻿ol.
I identify with Paul the Apostle, glad to be called a fool for Jesus Christ.
You're just a fo﻿ol...period.
The saddest result, perhaps, of these political machinations is that children will be influenced to doubt what and who they really are as God's Grand Creation with Inestimable Value.
Is that any worse than the nonsense in the bible?
Since there isn't any nonsense in the Bible, these things surely are worse.
No nonsense in the bible? That's funny, scouty!!
None at all and you KNOW it or you would not misquote it
I figured it out by age 5. The good thing is children will have access to healthcare, information, medicine, treatment and support. None of which existed for transexuals when I was a little girl growing up in the 1970's and 80's.
What a sick, Satan possessed world we live in.
Stand by for it to get much worse.
The world is not possessed by satan.
sure it is unless you are on the side of ISIS
Thankfully Obama is the first and last gay president. Not to mention black.
Just because Obama wants to pee in the ladies room doesn't mean the rest of America has to put up with it.
That's an odd fantasy.
you want to watch obama pee? YOU are sick
What are you talking about?
still pushing for yes on TG/gays?
Again, what are you talking about? Who said they wanted to watch Obama pee? And, who is pushing you to say on TG/gays?
you do and so does SB its about FORCED deviance without that no sense would be possible
I can't speak for SB, but I don't want to watch anyone pee, nor do I care if you (or anyone else) watches someone else pee.
fine then lets leave the bathrooms alone
When have I said to mess with a bathroom?
you asked what I was talking about did you not? which really meant change the bathrooms
No, you asked who wants to see Obama pee. I then asked what are you talking about, because no one had said they want to watch him pee.
I think you do but its about forced perversion or else
Again, claiming things I've never said
nothing EVER is said but pro perversion
So, what you say is pro perversion then?
why else do you want sense from me? what you need is AGREEMENT with a sick lifestyle SOCIALISMLESS @SB117 for liberals ... that is normal
Could this be the real reason, as to why Ms. Clinton basically stopped wearing dresses and pantyhose? Could she possibly have possessed the wisdom to determine what a high-risk liability it would be, having pantyhose entangled about her ankles, as an unknown man entered the ladies room with her, unbeknownst, or did Mr. Clinton simply forewarn her, as to the potential danger? Will the left seek to ban ladies from wearing pantyhose, next, and maybe even dresses, deeming such to be an unnecessary risk within the ladies room?
0/10
-1/10
her first move God forbid will be to ban dresses
Yeah, a real danger that will happen, I'm sure.
want men wearing dresses not me
You have a very active imagination.
Do I want men wearing dresses? No, but not freaked out by it either.
either but that will be the next drug
You forgot to take yours, clearly...
will be the next drug?
already is since the court failed to require churches to marry gays
You need a gibberish->English translator to understand any of his posts.
I do right now because these post aren't making any sense.
As is usually the case with Wayne.
Laugh only a pro gay/TG post would EVER make sense to you stop the no sense lie!
No, seriously read your post. It didn't make any sense. Not even talking the opinion it stated. Referring to the phrasing.
lie you are redefining sense to mean disagreement
No, I'm trying to figure out what you are saying. You're asking questions claiming someone wants stuff they haven't mentioned.
not at all you are desperately pushing for a pro deviant answer from me nothing else can make sense but that.its an old liberal game I see all the time unless I say yes to gay marriage and TG bathrooms I can never make sense to you
I just want you to make sense. You're saying stuff like transgenders are the new drug. Be against gays and transgender people all you want, but please make sense when you write so others can understand you.
Not at all you want me to agree with gays and TGs or it will be impossible to make sense to you its a tiresome liberal game that can never allow different opinions
Another claim of something I've never said. I am fine with you not agreeing with or liking gays or transgenders, and have never said otherwise. People can have different opinions.
you aren't...but I am....
Why?
Actually, the reason she wears pants suits is to better hide the fact she's wearing depends and they might leak!
Such is a plausible hypothesis, and if true, perhaps they are customized with body enhancements; nevertheless, she and her party are attacking women, via the Alinsky playbook.
Trans people have always used the bathroom/facilities of the gender they're living as. Conservatives just like discrimination and want to create potentially explosive situations. They seem to thrive on that in fact.
Really, it's a distraction. Nobody in their right mind would think this was a problem.
It's not, as long as it's not a law. A law saying that men can be in the ladies room, lets ALL men come in...that means rapists, and pedophiles. I've been in ladies rooms and noticed transgenders...they aren't what scares me...rapists and pedophiles do.
What law is saying that? What in the world are you talking about? All you're doing is confirming my point.
All men can already come in the women's bathroom. Most places have no law against that. The people trying to pass laws are the Republicans insisting that people use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate. So what laws are you talking about?
It's the same subset of people that think SCOTUS passed a "law" allowing SSM.
THERE WERE 102 GAYS SHOT IN ORLANDO OVER THE GAY RULING WHERE WERE THEIR EQUAL RIGHTS?
It was over the ruling? Really? Source?
*crickets
sure all over the news the killer did it because of Sharia Law which is why the media deflected to his weapon. that showed what a LIE equal rights is
So, no source on your claim. Ok then.
NO they haven't and they'd better not. Not that I'd do anything about it, but there are a whole lot of people who would! Obama or no Obama. His legacy apparently is to be the President who has went against the will of the people who elected him more than anyone before him!
Has anyone heard if Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr, and other celebrities and corporations who condemned/boycotted NC are going to do the same to these other states? All I have heard is ..... crickets... Come on, where is the equality in your outrage, liberals? I can't hear you!
They haven't passed their Jim Crow laws yet.
You want slavery BACK that is why you want forced perversion you are calling that equality
What forced perversion?
which you push like mad I get so sick of the lie called equal rights
You didn't answer the question. What forced per⁠version? If you're sick of the nons⁠ense you make up, stop saying it.
you never ASKED one you are making a statement and want compliance
For the third time; what forced perversion?
and answer not desired
I didn't think so. All you know is the talking point on its face; you can't ever defend it.
Your only point is forced compliance of perversion
Fourth time; What forced compliance of perversion?
Don't expect an answer to your question. I doubt you'll get one from him.
I don't expect one. I'm hoping that he'll eventually realize he's a c⁠o⁠w⁠ard and s⁠h⁠u⁠t up.
because you are demanding COMPLIANCE or fines that is the only "answer" you will bother with
Fines for what?
I'm just pointing out that you haven't answered the first 3 times the question was asked, so don't expect an answer on the 4th time.
Who cares?
Thats awsome! I hope the boycott ruins that states finances and the current AG becomes NCs next Govener.
yep and your own kids will get raped by a pedophile in a shared bathroom then YOU will be crying. or will you? women have bodies in bedrooms but not bathrooms!
NC made itself the poster boy for this repulsive legislation which is why they are being singled out. Where is the conservative outage over Dennis Hastert, Mark Foley and Larry Craig?
There was outrage over it. Didn't all of those men go to jail for their crimes? Has nothing to do with allowing someone to go into any bathroom of their choice.
These are celebrities? They are monkeys howlling at the moon! North Carolina has the right to make laws for their own state. Obama does NOT, and neither do any of your so called celebrities! What you and many others forget is that the United States of America is a collection of dependent states having their own morals and laws. Obama thinks that President means KING. It doesn't. It means limited leader. There are many things he cannot legally do, and this happens to be one of them!
If states can ignore real federal laws and allow people to consume controlled substances for recreational usage, states can ignore imaginary federal laws and keep moving forward in a sane and rational way.
I was thinking the same thing. Couldn't these states sue and claim why are some cities and states ignoring federal immigration laws
It's interesting that a law enforcement agency, the Executive Branch, can now order people to obey laws that don't exist. Cop pulls a guy over and says "Get out of that car, you are no longer allowed to drive". Guy says, "Why, what law did I break?" Cop says "My law, I'm ordering you to get out and never drive again." Guy says, "But . . . but . . . but . . . you can't do that, it's unconstitutional." Cops says "I just did it and if you don't obey you're going to jail." Guy says, "But why me?" Cop says "I don't like your hair cut".
Nothing will get better until U.S. Resident Obama is removed from the oval office... 50 million plus illegal aliens are a large portion of the demoRATic voter base... we do you think demoRATs are doing everything they can to keep ID's out of the voting booths. Fraud in fraud out!
Trump will clean house of these incompetent anti American democrat hacks of Obama's. Things will change and America will get back to enforcing the law. TRUMP 2016!
Vaughan cited the case of Sarah Root, who was killed in a car crash in Omaha, Neb., in January after Eswin Mejia slammed his car into hers while he was intoxicated and drag racing. Mejia is an illegal immigrant who arrived into the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor, and who had several previous brushes with the law, said Vaughan. “The local detectives asked ICE five times for a detainer on Eswin Mejia, but ICE said that he was not a priority for enforcement because he had not been convicted of a serious crime,” Vaughan said. “He was released on bail and disappeared, and is now on ICE’s most wanted list. It was a major scandal for ICE.” In another instance, Johnny Josue Sanchez, 21, a Honduran national in the country illegally who had been arrested three times, allegedly killed five homeless people when he set fire to a vacant building in Los Angeles. In this case, Vaughan said the combination of ICE’s and Los Angeles’s disinterest in removing Sanchez after so-called previous “minor” offenses resulted in tragedy. In yet another case, Marilyn Pharis, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, was brutally raped and bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer on July 24, 2015, in her own home. Victor Aureliano Martinez Ramirez, 29, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was arrested six times in the previous 15 months, was one of two men charged in the case. Keep in mind that Hillary wants to grant our American Citizenship to 11.6 million illegal aliens with 6.6 million of them being Mexicans! Its called pandering to the Hispanic Voters who support her.
whats up with the civil rights and American citizens?
thats for us, not foreigners
Paid foreign insurgents Dont matter in the USA.
Indeed, everywhere one looks into Obama’s background, we find sealed records, scrubbed websites, altered documents, deception and unanswered questions. Can anyone imagine for a second if John McCain or George Bush had blocked access to his school, medical, and birth records? It would have been headlines in their case, but as with everything else concerning Obama, the media has given him a pass on this. Of all these marvels, the latest mystery and probably most perplexing is that of Obama’s social security number. It appears that Obama has multiple identities in term of possessing numerous social security numbers. Orly Taitz, an attorney who has filed numerous suits against Obama regarding his eligibility to serve as president, appears to have been the first to discover this. In her suit, representing a number of military officers who are refusing to serve under an ineligible commander in chief, she hired private investigator Neil Sankey to conduct research on Obama’s prior addresses and Social Society numbers. Using Intelius, Lexis Nexis, Choice Point and other public records, Sankey found around 25 Social Security numbers connected with Obama’s name. However, it may not be as many as 25, since Sankey also searched using closely related names such as: “Barak Obama,” “Batock Obama,” “Barok Obama,” and “Barrack Obama.” There may very well be some Kenyans living in America with the same last name and a similar first name. In any case, I will exclude these records for the purpose of this research and focus only on names spelled exactly like his name. Moreover, we can verify many of the Social Security numbers as valid since they’re connected to addresses at which we know Obama resided. Needless to say, there are also a slew of address and social security numbers connected to addresses in states that Obama has no known connection to. In Obama’s home state, Illinois, Sankey tracked down 16 different addresses for a Barack Obama or a Barack H. Obama, of which all are addresses he was known to have lived at. Two Social Security numbers appear for these addresses, one beginning with 042 and one starting 364. In California, where Obama attended Occidental College, there are six addresses listed for him, all within easy driving distance of the college. However, there are three Social Security numbers connected to these addresses, 537 and two others, each beginning with 999. There are no addresses listed in New York where he attended Columbia University, but there is one listed for him in nearby Jackson, NJ, with a Social Security number beginning with 485.
He did like millions of Mexicans and other illegals have done. Used a dead person number or made up a number. Some even use their children number if they were born in the U.S. A fake social security card in Phoenix runs about $100
713 Hart Senate Office Building In Massachusetts – where Obama attended Harvard Law School – we find three addresses, all using the 042 Social Security number. After Obama was elected to the United States Senate in 2005, he moved into an apartment at 300 Massachusetts Ave NW; the Social Security number attached to that address is the 042 one. Yet, three years later, Obama used a different Social Security number for an address listed as: 713 Hart Senate Office Building. This was the address of his United States Senate office. This Social Security number began with 282 and was verified by the government in 2008. This mystery grows even stranger as other addresses and Social Security numbers for Barack Obama appear in a dozen other states not known to be connected to him. Again, I am excluding those records names not spelled exactly like his name. * Tennessee, one address with a Social Security number beginning with 427 * Colorado, one address, with a Social Security number beginning with 456. * Utah, two addresses, with two Social Security numbers beginning with 901 and 799. * Missouri has one address and one Social Security number beginning with 999. * Florida has two addresses listed for his him, three if you count one listed as “Barry Obama.” One is connected to a Social Security number beginning with 762. * In Georgia there are three addresses listed for him, all with different Social Security numbers: 579, 420, and 423. * In Texas there are four different addresses listed for him, one is connected to Social Security number 675. * There are two addresses listed for Barack Obama in Oregon and one address listed for him in the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania. All told, there are 49 addresses and 16 different Social Security numbers listed for a person whose name is spelled “Barack Obama.” In some cases, the middle initial “H” is listed. If you were to expand the search to include closely related names such as: “Barac,” “Barak,” and “Barrack” Obama, you would find more than a dozen additional addresses and Social Security numbers. Finally, the one Social Security number Obama most frequently used, the one beginning with 042, is a number issued in Connecticut sometime during 1976-1977, yet there is no record of Obama ever living or working in Connecticut. Indeed, during this time period Obama would have been 15-16 years old and living in Hawaii at the time. Ann, Stanley and Madelyn Dunham
My Bro is our PD's volunteer Spanish Interpreter and he's on call 24/7. A while back he was called out in the middle of night to help identify an highly intoxicated suspected illegal, who had just caused a very serious auto accident. After several cups of coffee, he able to ascertain this man was from Honduras and had been deported twice before. So, the PD's officer in charge calls ICE and request his pick up,..which is Promptly Denied! They said " sober him up and turn loose!" Now ,that's Simply amazing and true! Where is our government?
Vote Republican 2016: Because, you ever notice, liberals never look work-boots?

FIGURE IT OUT FROM THERE
We, the Americans Know u r a insurgent p o s NOW. Social Security started when u foreign p o s?
Someone had a social security number issued to them in 1898? You sure? LOL
He means the person who originally had that ss# was born in 1898.
maybe date is wrong but facts are facts he is illegal as a belly boarder crawlin mexitrash

Cut off Federal funding and arrest anyone getting in the way for aiding and abetting, obstruction of justice and everything else that might stick.
I know a Scotsman who was deported for overstaying visa one day, he was at the departure area of LAX leaving the country and is now barred from returning, he is a security consultant for people working abroad and is married to an American, the reason for the harsh treatment can only be because he is white. This is the world you liberals are making for yourself.
HE WAS WHITE AND SPOKE ENGLISH
These people need to be deported and shot if they come back. Also, the people aiding and abetting the illegal aliens need to go directly to jail, behind the bars!
Its failing has failed to remove any illegals period there all criminal
Any U.S. Citizen voting for Hillary Clinton is the intellectual equivalent of a chicken rooting for Colonel Sanders.
I case you haven't noticed nothing works under Dim. control. What is it about the word "illegal" Dim's do not understand? Why do we write laws that are not enforced? Vote Trump!
Hillary's support of Sanctuary cities is about as bad as her support for BlackLivesMatter. How do you help fix any social injustices by burning down you own city and randomly attacking white people on the streets? Someone please explain to me how that works. Remember BLM was invited to the White House by Obama. Again, how does that work when five police officers lost their lives protecting BLM protesters in Dallas and Hillary refused to seek the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police. How does that work? Perhaps a Hillary supporter would like to explain. Even at the DNC convention when a silent prayer was taking place BLM people in the audience jeered during the silent prayer for the fallen officers. Please Hillary supporters explain that one to me. We need law and order in this country. No US citizen black, white, Latino, Asian, has the right to destroy people property without consequences. But it's okay if you are black protesting about a criminal with a gun who refused to put down his gun and was shot and killed by police. What would you have done?

mcd All lives matter Mr. Obama and Mr. Johnson, not just your future democrats here illegally.
mcd NOT ALL,,,,,,, ILLEGALS CRMINALS AND MUSLIMS NOT SO MUCH!!!!
Obama does not want illegal criminals deported, PERIOD! One of his reason is because his uncle would then be deported instead of being given a free pass to commit more crimes. His uncle is protected, ICE has been ORDERED to stay away from him, and local law enforcement has been told they are not to arrest him or harass him anymore. Look it up, this is true.
OBAMA IS AN ILLEGAL ALIEN THE SS# HE USES IN THE WHITE HOUSE WAS ISSUED IN CONNECTCUT IN LIKE 1898 TO A FRENCH NATIONAL THAT BECAME A CITIZEN HERE MOVED TO HAWAII IN 1960 AND DIED IN 1961......

FIGURE IT OUT FROM THERE
Wrong. Social security started when??
Should be a bounty for civilians who apprehend and turn over illegals to ICE. They say they have to few agents, this would hugely expand the forces on the street. Of course, there needs to be total E-verify compliance enforced to prevent undocumented people from holding jobs. If we want to enforce our immigration laws we can, but the facts are we as a society do not have the political will to do so. I suspect in 50 years the U.S.A. as a true s,overeign nation will have been so diluted as to not exist.
CREATE JOBS A NEW BOUNTY HUNTER WANTED DEAD OR ....... ALIVE/ NOT SO MUCH!!!!!
If you are in Mexico working illegally any Mexican can arrest you, law enforcement personnel or not.

That's because the leftist media refused to report it. In the minds of the liberal lemmings, if mediamatters didn't report it, it never happened.
AND EVERYWHERE ELSE IN DUMMYCRAP DISTRICTS THE DEAD VOTE
Government can't take care of anything. It's time to do away with it all and farm every section out to private sector. Government jobs are all friends and family of mostly unqualified people including President. They make too much money after year jobs are tenured and you can't get rid of them. All they can do is move them to another section and keep paying them for nothing while their job position automatically get step increases. The bigger the government gets the worse our country functions and the worse off the public is.
Sanctuary is a function of the Catholic Church. States are not suppose to impose their Religion over the citizens of the US. The people under Sanctuary are suppose to be housed and remain on Church Grounds. At the expense of the Church. Until a determination of resolve between the State and Church can be made concerning the individual. An individual that leaves the Church grounds is subject to the full extent of the Law. The State is liable for the damages caused by the imposing of the Catholic Religion on the people.
When the blatant anti- Christian asault by the Administration and Democrats at every level is ceased then some credence can be accorded to the "sanctuary" argument. SANCTUARY cities are run by virulent secularists and Liberals. They are a recruiting ground for ILLEGAL voters and a means to bolster the population for districting purposes. Sadly the American catholic Church is only afactor when some Liberal tenet can be contrived, If the Catholic Church had any real clout every legislator,Pelosi and Biden comes to mind,purporting to be a Catholic and being supporters of any and all legislation supporting abortion and taxpayers paying for it would be publicly excommunicated. That has not happened and the Catholic Church is no longer the bastion of morals that could once influence elections. Sanctuary Cities are the creation of Liberals looking for support from legal minorities. RELIGIONhas nothing to do with it unless you are an amoral athiest...
I think cutting off federal funds to cities who do not enforce current law is a dandy idea. Nothing would make them move faster to fix that sanctuary attitude of aiding and abeting illegals in the commission of a crime - staying here illegally, working here using false papers (fraud) or worse.
Sanctuary Is a place of refuge for Individuals that are appealing to the people of a State and not the State itself. A plea for personal protection in full recognition of their gilt in the breaking of the laws of a State. A safe zone of apprehension by the People for the protection of all. Where they can safely present their case of circumstances that led them to having no other alternative than to brake the States Laws. For when a State itself is involved in the granting of Sanctuary it is in conflict of interest to itself and the people thereof.
The Obama administration counts the young girls that are kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery south of the border, those that die in the desert and drown in the Rio Grande as deportations !! LTFOL

NONE WOULD BE DUMMYCRAPS FOR LONG,,,,,, OH YA FORCE THEM TO WORK AND GIVE THE MONEY TO THE GOV. NO WELFARE, EBT, FREE HOUSING ETC.......
Liberals are good at spending OTHER people's money.
They will give away anything they don't own.
If all it took to fix illegal immigration was burn down some liquor and clothing stores and beat up whites randomly by mob violence Democrats would of already fixed it. cincyman Tired of law enforcement based upon political correctness? Then make sure you vote. And vote for Trump.
I think the maximum age to abort a liberal should be 40 years old. After that age, all the drugs and alcohol will tear them down fast anyway
Clearly the will of The People doesn't matter. This is what happens when Liberals are in control. End the madness...TRUMP / PENCE 2016
Democrats sure can't fix anything and they sure can keep information secure but they sure can empty a liquor store and burn it to the ground completely easy enough.

LOL. How's Obamacare been doing so far? Shows you how much a gov't healthcare program works.Quick summary since you seem to have missed it: Lost BILLIONS so far when Oblunder promised it would save taxpayers hundreds of millions. Has hurt & cost more people than it has helped. Yup, gov't efficiency hard at work.
HSA were brought into play during the Bush years, and it is still the only viable health plan. The government failed with the mail system, why on earth do you think they can get the health care right?

we need to hang all the illegal vermin. Starting with the ones that don't have birth certificates that are real.
Liberals = protecting the criminals and hanging American citizens out to dry
Are you tired of the liberals coddling illegals and criminals? Then make sure you vote - for Trump.
and anyone who backs him
I remember when I lived in LA several years ago. The Hispanics wanted to make a statement about how much they were "needed" to do all the jobs. So they had what they called "Day without a Mexican" where they all stayed home from work in protest. Totally backfired on them. There was no traffic on the freeways (unheard of in LA), all the businesses functioned without issue, and all the white people asked when they were gonna have another one.
YEAH BUT AT LEAST THE MEX'S ARE WILLING TO WORK AND NOT BECOME PROUD LIBERAL CRIMINALS LIKE SO MANY BLACKS ARE EXHIBITING!
US citizens are just collateral damage in the Lefts quest to make America brown...
So, according to my federal government, it's OK to refuse to cooperate with ICE to turn over illegal aliens for deportation and it's not OK for local and state governments to round up illegal aliens running amok in the streets of their cities for deportation? I see the problem.... My Federal Government!!! Good thing I can vote!!!!!
We are in a situation we cannot vote ourselves out of. Propaganda has control of women's minds, the only solution is armed resistance against anything related to the Federal Govt.
By law, local law enforcement agencies are supposed to turn illegal immigrants over to the feds for deportation when they are due to be released from custody, but illegal immigration advocates say the policy violates the subject’s civil rights. What "civil rights" do non-citizens in this country? None!
Don't do anything until Trump gets in. Then we can clean house of illegals, and sentence them to Building the Wall and then make sure they are on the Mexican side when it is complete. Its a Win Win
LOVE THE IDEA
Jeh Johnson is another political hack. Here in Arizona we are flooded with illegal immigrant criminals and the only law enforcement agency to take action, Sheriff Joe Arpaio's Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, has been stopped from his program to weed out these felons. It seems to me that it would benefit the supporters of Mexican and Central American immigration to remove the felons from their neighborhoods but that doesn't appear to be the case. Congress needs to pass a bill to stop federal funding for sanctuary cities NOW! It's interesting that liberals want more federal power but when it comes to issues like this they spout about LOCAL control. We cannot afford any more illegals. We need to get our own house in order before we go back to saving the world!
Saving the World = Ridding America of Liberals
I love Sheriff Joe.
pushing 80 something and probably will get reelected. He is doing something right.

It seems, most of our government is seriously broken. I recently witnessed 7 Seattle "city workers" standing around a hole watching a backhoe bucket work.
The person leaning in the flag was paid the most.
That's an old one but props for bringing it up during the Olympics. It makes it contemporary. So, at least one like for style points.
why did that comment get deleted. " why don't Mexicans do well in the olympics
It could just be that he's a bit embarrassed. It happens. Or Fox could have deleted it. It happens.
Stop screwing with the taxpayers safety and security. If you liberal police chiefs cant follow the law of the land, then its high time you find another occupation.
ANY illegal immigrant caught committing any crime or receiving any welfare should be immediately deported. Biometric scanned and informed if caught in USA without proper paperwork again will be on a trip to prison to work on chaingang fixing our roads etc. No if's ands or buts. Follow rules or suffer the consequences
White young women lives matter. Unless your ICE
Tired of all this liberal nonsense? Then make sure you vote - for Trump.
Q. How do you circumcise a liberal? A. Kick his boyfriend in the chin.
Ok we have a winner:)
Liberals backed by Liberal officials all deciding which laws they feel like following......They all belong in jail for participation in - and aiding and abetting criminal acts
The Voice of the Illegal Aliens is now louder then the American Peoples.
Thanks to the DNC.
We all knew this was happening. Now we better start checking the voting machines am sure Trump is right on voter fraud also.
How do you break up a riot in Milwaukee? Drop paternity tests from a helicopter into the crowd of thugs
Or drop job applications....
or work boots
They would just make paper airplanes out of them.
Criminal illegal aliens. Isn't that a little redundant? I can't believe how dumbed down this country has become.
Thank bill Clinton.
Time to vote out those who would put illegal aliens before the citizens of this country......
Globalization is only concerned with the Elite controlling the Commoners and everything else.
Q. How do you starve a Democrat? A. Hide his EBT card under his work shoes.
You can't rob a democrat, all you can do is get your money back
Q. Why don't you run over a liberal on a bike? A. It's probably your bike.
Q. What do you call a liberal on a bike? A. Thief.
Globalization is only concerned with the Elite controlling the Commoners and everything else!
Wasteful and ineffective programs - there's an extremely small number of murders in this country by released illegals . . .
There shouldn't be any Illegal is Illegal
That small number is too many.
I wouldn't mind if the illegals murdered just liberals, that would be poetic justice.... but the murder of innocents (aka non-liberals) is intolerable.
Just read an article that says the murder rate for Illegals is 5 times higher
Yes by other illegals or Democrats.
what number will make you happy?
Not true. First off over 300 convicted time served MURDERER illegals were RE RELEASED back into the UNited States......and over 100,000 Violent Felon illegals with them. All during Obama's time in office.
So you would rather live in a country that doesn't follow its own laws. That's called anarchy.
One is just one too many, Chico.
It's like in the movie "The Help." Those poor black people in the south didn't have any hope until that privileged white girl showed up and started the whole Civil Rights Movement!
This is an easy problem to fix. If you are one of these a-hole politicians or police chiefs unwilling to hand over dangerous criminals, and that dangerous criminal kills someone you are responsible for manslaughter and should be prosecuted as such. Period. No negotiation, no plea bargaining, none of it. You're responsible. Still want to harbor these folks? We as a people need to demand this. It's absolutely unacceptable, and a dereliction of their sworn duty to protect the public.
Charges should include but not be limitted to: Deriliction of duty Conduct unbecoming Obstruction of Justice accomplice before the fact
if it were only that's simple....not that I don't agree...completely.
Q. Why do they bury liberals 2 foot deep when they die? A. So they can still get a "hand out" BWAAAAA HAAAAA HAAAAA
You wasted time on that? Bwaa haa haa teabags got nothing.
<< got nothing?
There is No God. Santa Never Came Down the Chimney. There is too much senseless Violence.
and yet these fools still vote for Dems
For and by Democrats it's "Pittsburg STEAL"
Give money to freedom give to the George Soros Charity. Open Society is a freedom organization that works with all people wanting to be free.
If you believe that, you've been deceived.
"Give us all your money so we can make you rich and independent?"
The only thing you liberals want "free" is your social programs that us conservatives pay for. Get a job, freeloader
I paid $87,000 in taxes last year....How much did you pay?
Sure you did Skippy. Sure you did.
I own a ten year old successful small business. Something you only dream about.
yeah seanny you're dreams are a farce
Cooking meth seems to be working out for you. I paid around $40K.
Like I said....How much did you pay?
The only thing free in your society are herpes and hemorrhoids
so madame wookie wants to play too
Epitomy of arrogance and sef-righteousness whose inner circles are Valerie Jarrett and bill Ayers, Rv Wright.....Ho w dare she sit in judgement..how dare she sit in the white house and verbally degrade it! Where's your political correctness now? Time to move out Michelle!
Michele Tarzans calling
We have never had a spoiled, thankless, America-hating THING for a First Lady before this wicked witch.
Except Nancy Reagan.
Deneen, how can you betray your black brothers and sisters? The First Lady channels Martin Luther King and you dare to sit there and deride her? What kind of person are you? You have the look of a mature beautiful young lady, but then you say the words that you do under the guise of religion with that religious symbol around your neck when clearly you do not take the words of the Sermon in the Mound to heart. I'm only White and I evidently know better than you about what you should know deeper than I can ever know. How much money is in your pocket from taking advantage of the selling out of your race? Those on the Conservative Right who don't embrace the light of day take great pleasure in your defection, and those of your race who are in poverty and lack opportunity because of the prejudice against them should haunt your dreams at night. And if you have an honest bone in your body. You will be haunted until the day you become honest with yourself about what you are doing. Shame on you! Grow up!
You took a lot of time to say nothing.
If Michelle is 'channeling' MLK then I want to change the channel. Never has he been cited as an excuse to base everything on skin color. AS SHE DOES.
Michelle is lying...Trump sad he wants to build a wall to keep the illegals out and he wants to deport the illegals currently in the US...he never said he wanted to deport those that are here legally. The Democrats need the illegals here to vote for them!!
Michelle is lying...Trump sad he wants to build a wall to keep the illegals out and he wants to deport the illegals currently in the US...he never said he wanted to deport those that are here legally. The Democrats need the illegals here to vote for them!!
Name Calling?... Poor little PC cupcakes... Can't bring themselves to mention Radical Islam Terrorist.
and Hilary is innocent and says none of that.....NOT! Michelle, shut your pie hole no cares what you think. Go redecorate something
Moochelle Nobama takes swipe at Trump it sez. Trump better look out, apes have a long reach.
Racist much?
just callin' a spade, a spade. oops
"She also said Americans “don't build up walls to keep people out because we know that our greatness has always depended on contributions from people who were born elsewhere but sought out this country and made it their home." Does she consider herself American or African-American or just African.....Was it not Michelle that said “People in this country are ready for change and hungry for a different kind of politics and … for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.” Really? After benefiting from being a minority?
Its funny how he bloviates about others not accepting him and anybody else thats frakish, yet doesn't he's doing the same thing
and progs never do anything hypocritical. Guess it takes a hypocrite to know one.
This country has been paying for your families elaborate trips, while 1 in 6 children here in the United States go to bed hungry each nite..... millions of dollars spent (TAXPAYER MONEY) ON VACATIONS and all we hear is INCOME Equality..... that is a complete joke..... WAKE UP AMERICA.....
My entire family including me, my wife, my kids and grandkids entire wardrobes could not be valued at $20,000.00- the amount the Obama girls paid for their individual party dresses. Many in America are "waking up" and are fed up with a government that works harder at seeing the wealthy get theirs while tens of millions of American men and women are out of work, while many who were at one time productive workers with homes for their families, families who participated in community and school activities and were working to achieve the American Dream has been pushed aside to allow immigrants, legal and illegal, to come here and work! Obama and his administration has turned their backs on the American people and America! Obama is quick to point our how many new jobs were created in America but ; he never points out how many were lost, how many of the jobs filled were filled with immigrant workers (his own Labor Department says 3 out of four jobs in America is being taken by immigrants (legal and illegal) or how many men and women who at one time had jobs have run out of unemployment benefits, can not get work and are no longer counted in the "Official" Unemployment numbers. He does not point out the massive, huge, and growing national debt that the nation has grown under his administration. Could it be Obama's endorsement of Hillary Clinton was done so history will have someone else to show as the worst president in our history? She has one of American politics worst personal records already; electing her president will end in disaster and Obama will no longer have to face the reputation of Americas Greatest Presidential failure and the books showing him as the worst president in our history! confussed "He's a fraud" "He's a thin skinned Fake" What lets delete that!
I am sorry..did she actually say this...The first lady on Friday also said some people “act as if name-calling is an acceptable substitute for thoughtful debate, as if anger and intolerance should be our default state rather than the optimism and openness that have always been the engine of our progress." Isn't President Obama the one that circumvents Congress whenever he wants to because they don't agree with him and he just signs an Executive Order that have on several occasions violated the Constitution?? If that isn't hypocritical I don't know what is....
When that water buffalo and her "hateful eight" POS husband vacate the WH, we can be proud of America again!
I spent 19 months in Vietnam I never saw a water buffalo that ugly. Former marine RVN 9-67 to 3-69 1st Amtrak @ Cau Viet & 2/9 Camp Carroll & Quang Tri
Water buffalo, LOL, Perfect.
I bet the transvestites are elated that Michelle and her girls will never have to share a locker room or bathroom with them.
Does anyone care about anything about what she cares???? Diversity? How about TRASHY!!!
Trump " What's Michele's dress size for a going away party, 18, 20, 22. My wife wears a 6, end of discussions!"
First "Lady"? I beg to differ. That's no lady.
I will miss Michelle Obama- ski when she leaves the White House... NOT !!!!
She really needs to explain how she got a high paying job with the U of Chicago Hospital when her husband became Senator, for which she had no qualifications. She really helped the poor--her job was to send them to other hospitals so the U of Chicago Hospital did not have to pay for their care. Good job Michelle. I hope you are packing.
it's called a No Work Contract, which is big bucks going to a person that has a free ride....NWCS are very popular in Chicago, some others call NWCS....money laundering.
And her job was so important that when she left, they did not put anyone else in it. I wish I could get so much free money for being black.
She should had taken at least one against her husband for being the worst president in U.S. history
well she should add that not only slaves built the white house. An irish born immigrant was the architect, with a team of free men (african and european), with some slaves. If we are being honest.
You are being honest. She is not.
pot calling kettle black...
Do the Democrats plan on drafting her for the nomination if Bizaro, I mean Hillary is indited? They seem to really like putting her out to the public.
ONLY SHE IS BETTER OFF.......FOR THE LAST 7.5 YEARS.........
If she believes what she says, she should publicly condemn the "anger and intolerance" liberals inflicted on Trump supporters in San Jose, CA. But, we all know she will not.
That silver back NEVER looks good
After eight years she finally comes out of the woodwork? She should stick to screwing up school lunches for the little kids.
Monkey face... man she is scary.
I want a Bumper Sticker with mooch-elles face stating does this A55 make my truck look fat?
Just curious...why do or should we care what she has to say?
'Good question...
Michelle, the lady,who got a free ride all her life because of her color, but wasn't n proud to be an American until her husband got elected President, isn't qualified to judge Trump.
Spoken like a true Wookie.
Is it me or does she also look like "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas?"
Here's the thing, for me, on immigration. It's like having company at your home. Guests arrive at your front door, they knock, you let them in. Maybe you offer them a beverage, have a nice chat. If those same people broke into your home, damaged your home, and treated you like garbage, you would defend your home. You would not invite them back. For over 200 years, we have had guests come to our American front door. We've invited them in, helped them get settled, made them part of our great American Family. That's who we are. But the criminals who insist on breaking down the back door to get in illegally, and then expect the rest of us to just say it's OK, are just not welcome. Go to the front door, knock, and we'll let you in. Otherwise, go home.
Well written, outstanding , please forward to Trump ad let him use it.
At least trump has a wife that is easy on the eyes, MOOCHELL makes is so hard to look at.. just hideously ugly..
Oh, come on. Pathetically uncalled for / inappropriate.
Sorry - just playing the game of Politics Liberals developed, and I guess I hit a nerve, called the truth?
My point was she can't help the genetic "cards" she was dealt any more than you or I (or anyone else) can. Carve her up on her totally B.S. liberalbeliefs. THOSE she can be held responsible for/criticized for legitimately...
"She also said Americans “don't build up walls to keep people out..." We DON'T. We build "walls" to keep illegal - illegal - illegal aliens out. The woman is a completely CLUELESS, pro-illegal immigration, leftyTOOL.
She lives behind a wall guarded by guys with guns, and lectures the rest of us.
Yeeeeup. (Actually, it's a fence, isn't it?)
This is at a college commencement speech? So rather than making the day about them, it was about Trump? Inappropriate....and tacky.
The Obamas have no shame. Shouldn't she be providing advice to those who are about to start their new lives? Instead, she is just trying to further the democrat agenda.
Woman doesn't know here place.
If you ever see her interact with Barack...she definitely wears the pants
and a strap on
Jesus, can she not really find her way to the back of the bus again?
Obama did not show any dignity when he was the commencement speaker at the Rutgers University in NJ: such guests are traditionally eminent citizens and are expected to tell the new graduates to work hard, with sincerity and integrity in their jobs in order to have a successful career. Instead, he took the opportunity to criticize and attack Trump. The first lady is doing the same thing now at another commencement proving that their meanness has only worsened after nearly eight years in the highest and most powerful office of the nation. What a shame and tragedy?
It seems that you and some others prefer to give graduates fluff instead of what is actually going on. Considering how many don't bother enough with what is real to dump Trump...what more is there to be said? Except we would be a lot better off doing more sorting out of what is real, especially graduates.
Donald Trump supporters - maketheunitedstatesgreatagain.com has a Trump style hat in Republican Red for every US State! Get yours today, shipping from east coast, USA. Listed vendor to Trump Campaign. Hat of the day - MAKE WASHINGTON GREAT AGAIN #nobama #Trump2016 #MAGA
Question? Hasn't any other First Lady taken swipes at their opponent Party's presidential candidates? For goodness sake, this is a College Commencement speech show just a little class Michele. This again reveals her lack of grace and integrity as our nation's First Lady.
The First Lady Man is just a little bit ticked off at The Donald because if he is elected, his wife will be 1 million times more celebrated than was Michael. He/she is green with envy. Don't doubt me!
michele obama came out from Kitchen??Is beter to stay there and take brother Trumpet with her!!!
She gives a commencement speech at a college that has a 9.6% 4 year graduation rate. Well done.
I think that is probably one more commencement speech than you have given
Methuen @rdennisuk @OSYM OSYM's comment is relevant. Yours is not.
and 1 more then you have ever heard
Well, you have to understand that black students can't be expected to understand things about American culture. Because they are from Africa and they don't speak the language. Also, slavery has kept them down, has shut them out, and has left them wholly unable to compete with others in society. And if you're buying this, be sure and let me know how to contact you so that I can show you some prime oceanfront property that I have available on the cheap in downtown Memphis Tennessee. You can have your choice of Atlantic or Pacific Ocean.
dont forget the 20 TRILLION DOLLARS SPENT ON THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS ,SUPPOSE TO HELP THE DOWNTRODDEN BUT WENT TO LINE THE POCKET OF THOSE IN WASHINGTON.
First of all she was only tapped to give a commencement speech because she was lucky enough to be married to the man who was not qualified to be POTUS, but was voted in anyway, twice. Either people who come to the US undercover illegally are breaking the law or not. Which is it Michelle? If they aren't criminals then why have immigration laws at all? At your suggestion of a wall being built to keep "different" people out, whey don't we just do away with the entire immigration dept. and save money and let everyone in that wants to come. The catch will be that they will be dumped in your new tony D.C. neighborhood, living next to you, going to school with your daughters, and coming over for coffee each morning. Then maybe you can be proud for the second time in your life of America. January 2017 can't come soon enough, bon voyage baby!
The reason Trump supporters have such anger is the result of Michells husband..
How much does the U.S. owe China ? That's HIS results. I'd keep my mouth shut if I were you.
4 Trillion, not including 300,000 Million in interest per year..
This is what democrats have given us all through " affirmative Action" . A bunch of socialist libertards.. Minorities now hold more positions of power than the majority. What could possibly go wrong ?? (sarc)
This family is the worst to ever reside in the White House. Have they no shame? Obama who refused to apologize to Pearl Harbor victims apologizes to the country that killed them. What a most reprehensible act.
I hear that this dude Michelle plows Bong hit Barry on a nightly basis
Truly unbelievable that a sitting president, and his wife, are taking shots at a nominee!! Yet another disgraceful action by our JV president. What a joke....
Married to the worst president in history of this country , she really should take a look around the WH and see how Oblunder the wonder has divided this country.
Horse tooth jungle creaturrrrre!!
Moooooochel ought to be wiping not swiping her own $
That gutter trash has a lot of crust taking a swipe at anyone.
She needs to focus on WIPING not SWIPING.
No, get it right. It's not Michelle, but in reality MICHAEL Obama. She is a he.
Is that the reason buckwheat pass the lgbt bill with the help of the other gay scotus for his dude.
So the transgender bathroom idea came to Obama from "experience" at home?
When you don't know whether to stand or sit then you might not know where to take a… Dump!
Makes sense now, I wondered why they always were on separate planes, the same person can't fly together..
No one cares what that race baiting ugly dude in a dress has to say.
She is just as bad, if not worse than her husband. Good riddance to them both!
She also said Americans “don't build up walls to keep people out because we know that our greatness has always depended on contributions from people who were born elsewhere but sought out this country and made it their home." SAYS THE OBIMBO THAT LIVES BEHIND WALLS AND ARMED GUARDS On Wednesday, her husband, President Obama, also entered the 2016 debate in a speech in Indiana, saying the “Republican nominee” has “crazy” ideas, including one to deport the roughly 11 million immigrants now living illegally in the United States. DEPORT EM ALL THEY ARE CRIMINALS THEY ARE NOT IMMIGRANTS THEY ARE CRIMINALS
Kind of sad that this show never has anything relevant to say. It's more like Joan Rivers critique of people she don't lie .... without the comedy. That's all these people do is critize people who they clearly just don't like. Somehow, I think I could find more relevant things to put on TV.
Secret Service officer assigned to the White House during Bill Clinton’s presidency alleges that presumptive 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton “lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office.
I firmly believe Michelle Obama is a man. Honestly...
BARRACK INSANE OBAMA HAS ALREADY HAD HIS NUTS CUT FOR HIS TRANSFORMATION AFTER HE LEAVES OFFICE
You are firlmy Correct !
Michelle Obama is a MAN. Everyone knows that.
No. Only YOU and your Right Wing friends want us to believe that.
Will
Your level of hate is without boundary...im positive that, even if you have 9 lives, you would have died 9 times from an heart failure before your wish comes true. your cynical argumebt leaves me cold !
These comments are insane. A lot of you have severely missed the point of her comment and used it as an excuse to just be hateful. Watch the video and see the context in which she made the statement.
blacks Love being victims.
After victimizing them for more than 300 years (and continue to victimize them) what do you expect?
THE AFRICAN BLACKS HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF BLACKS FOR LONGER THEN THAT THE BLACKS SOLD THE BLACKS AS SLAVES THE PEOPLE HERE NOW HAVE NEVER BEEN SLAVES OR VICTIMS
She was not a slave, nor does she know any. All races have been mistreated or enslaved at some point in history. I am of Irish descent but I don't obsess about the English rule. I also have Cherokee blood, but I rarely think about how they were treated. Move on and stop using this as a political card. The President has no documented slaves in his family.
My only wish for them is one day they lose everything they have and have to live in a tent like most of Americans has to do thanks to his wonderful economy and open borders, I don't know how they can hold their head high and look Americans in the face.
Your level of hate for these people is without boundaries ..with this level of HATE, im sure, that even if you have 9 lives, you would die from a heart failure 9 times before your wish come true
You will die from a heart attack before ths happens
Sister Cleo?? Is that you?
cleo should have SEEN this coming
How impressive. She marries someone who occupies and degrades the office of President and she thinks her spiteful character is suddenly empowered. Someone else did all the work to give her that moocher pulpit. There are a lot of people who have earned their place in the world; she went from cherrypicking patients in a Chicago hospital at a salary far above her worth, to this. No hate-speech from her, especially in a setting she didn't earn, is going to change what she is.
There are simple facts that most normal people do not wake up every morning remembering. I am Slavic; I don't wake up every morning realizing my predecessors were slaves. This was perhaps one of the most divisive statements she has uttered, especially after 7 1/2 years of opportunities to make hope and change. Obama and Michelle have been utter failures, now leaving this Country in worldwide disarray with multiple enemies on several new fronts!
Lithuanian here...with a g-grandmum enslaved by the czar to teach their soon to be dead kids and a 10% Cherokee that predated the Trail of Tears and Irish and Scottish and maybe even some Jew...but that might just be the inherited nose yet every day we are all regarded as slave owners that need to murderedf by the racist liberal Nazis
The first lady falls not far from her husband
Don't suppose she watched the attacks on Trump rally attendees in San Jose by the mob of Hillary and Bernie supporters.
life is all about her. so she didn't give it a glance
Her life is all about her. Her "husband's" life is all about his. What a pair.
Sure she did and she was cheering for the rioters
SHE WAS HOPING SOME WHITE COP GOT KILLED
I wonder if Egyptian Africans wake up everyday obsessed by the fact that Hebrew slaves built the Pyramids?? Somebody should stage some protests over there. Throw some eggs, maybe. Maybe Israel can press Egypt for reparations. It's only been about 4 thousand years.
No. They will protest commemorating the Jews leaving Egypt.
I don't know why the Obummers aren't all over that one. You know, being 'African' and all.
If she doesn't like living in a house "built by slaves" then she should move out. The hypocrisy that fills the life of Obama and his wife is too great for either of them to throw darts at anyone else. Does she allow their daughters to use the same bathroom as the males use? Of course not, and not just because they are daughters of the president. She would not allow it but they don't care about the daughters of families. If Mrs. Obama was smart, she would stop pointing fingers at others.
Then she'll be pointing fingers at everyone for a very long time.
Quote of The Day; "Protests and racism weren't on the front page every day 8 years ago"
Her time might be better spent packing.
...not as much as you think since Hillary will be moving in...
... to prison.
OBAMA WILL BE HER CELLMATE AFTER HE HAS THE OPERATION
While Barack is rapidly going gray and looking tired, Michelle and the girls just keep getting more attractive.
Time for a vision check Mooch is looking more like Aunt Esther every day
U NEED A VISION CHECK U MUST HAVE CATARACTS
Trump is clearly getting to the dems Don't worry moochel Trump will never sexually harass you when he gets in the white house But watch out for billy. He might
...no but Trump's daughter better watch out...forTrump....
F THIS RACIST USELESS BEAST
Funny when white racists who have a long history of lynching, abusing, and murdering Black people call Black people racist.
You have never been a slave and I have never owed one !
Remember this tramp is part of the most TRANSPARENT administration EVER !!! Maybe she can play the "race card" again ????
More proof that the democRATS know they're in trouble.. Hey Moochelle keep you pie hole shut !!!!!
I visit this thread once in a while and see that the CONs have nothing but to call names and continue to roll in their gutter. I would think that the CONs would grow up someday, but that is only wishful thinking.
But to be fair, when your long suits are hatred, racism, and vitriol, you play them...over and over over again.
hard to have respect for someone who in a multi 6 figure a year job in an Chicago hospital....was on the committee that worked on a poor patient dumping scheme.
Did you notice that you cited no sources for that silly comment? We did.
you notice that you have a toolbar and the world is open for you to educate yourself...if you can type? go look it up.
Oh, no need to apologize. But you started this, after all. You made the comment, so it's up to you to support it. This was covered in 8th grade debate class. Anything else I can help you with today?
welcome. Let me know if you need more examples.
LOL
and storm....try and recall how the left name called and rolled in the gutter...as you say.....over Palin. so democrat women deserve respect....why?
Read the topic in question before you blame others for reacting - or is that too much work?
LOL...Not only are you all going to get Hillary...you're going to get Bill too...
Great. A President who was impeached. Maybe his wife can set a new record by getting impeached also. "The Dynamic Duo"
First Lady ?? Are you serious ?? Looks like a retired linebacker of the NFL....
Nothing but bitter words from the Skunk-ape. No surprise there.
Sigh. She's not much of a First Lady is she?
Nope. More of an embarrassment than anything.
But we will agree she's not as vacuous as Nancy Reagan.
I don't know what you are, but you'll obviously never be anywhere near as good a person as she was. Stop while you are behind.
Nothing the Obama gang does is a surprise any longer. Hillary promises (if elected) to continue the 'progress'. Trump, with his gaffes, is a far better bet to do some good things in Obama's nasty wake.
Name it after a gay pedophile? Not the smartest thing to do. I couldn't care less if he founded the Navy. You don't honor someone like that by naming ANYTHING after them
You mean the pedophile Harvey Milk? That one? Name a whole ship after a pedophile, wow.
Being ex-Navy, this is disgusting to me. "Other than honorable" discharge should have eliminated his name from possible choices.
Coming soon: The USS Micheal Brown
The good ship Lollypop?
Flying the Rainbow Flag.
I guess the Navy doesn't have any more deserving sailors they can honor. This political correctness is going to destroy one of the few remaining government organizations that still have some respect from the public.
Good comment!
you'll notice Fox didn't bother to mention the earlier ceremony the same day in Camp Pendleton naming a ship after MoH John Basilone (second ship named after him and it's a real warship DDG) Guess that wouldn't play into the narrative though huh?
They are also in the process of changing the Navy Fight song from "Anchors Away" to "In The Navy" by the Village People!
Welcome aboard the USS Milk, sailor! Seriously. I think the USS J. Christopher Stevens, the USS Tyrone Woods, the USS Glen Doherty, or the USS Sean Smith...American heroes who died for America instead of for their lifestyle, deviant or not, would be better able stomached.
Will they make a backdoor deal to get it commissioned?
USNS Harvey Milk. Aft boarding only.
The muslims will make an extra effort to blow it up
Jeffrey Dahmer was in the Army. How about naming a base after him?
USS PERVERSION
I don't understand. Isn't the Navy gay enough already?
Just like Milk, this ship will be full of sea-men.
Pathetic! If I was in the Navy when the ship comes out, I'd refuse to serve on it! This guy was no military anything, never served! Not a key United States government person, just a local nobody! Pathetic!
He served in the Navy for 4 years, but was forced out with an "Other than honorable" discharge. Shouldn't we be naming ships after people who received an honorable discharge at the very minimum??
USS MILK................. IT'S A FERRY............... I MEAN FAIRY !
Is it going to be crewed by the Village People?
Fleet Auxiliary General. F.A.G.
So, it's a ship that oils up other ships and hauls away their effluence? I guess, if you have politicians this determined to name a ship after a rumpranger an oiler is the best option.
I'll bet San Francisco is watering at the mouth to get it there for Fleet Week.
it will take a tsunami to wash the taste out of San Fran's bay
Good to see the Conservative hate machine rev up. Keep it up Cons--- you're quickly becoming irrelevant. Or is this the Christ-like behavior you're always talking about?
sorry tighter, this is just meanness today, I haven't seen any evangelizing here; must be tomorrow
Could you translate that into English for the rest of us?
Even if you define your life by a bad habit, it's still a bad habit. To define anyone by a sexual proclivity dismisses their free will out of hand.
No hatred by us-we just don't like Liberal/Lamocrats,like you.Maybe you should head down to Orlando.
How embarrassing for the Navy ....and America. Liberals have gleefully embraced every known perversion and deviance and are angry that sane people refuse to accept their sickness as 'normal'. Liberals - the very worst among us. Liberalism - America's greatest enemy.
They're planning to paint it pink with lace around the deck!
I find the pure hate the flows through the keyboards of the Fox "Christians" to be far more disgusting than anything Harvey Milk ever did
Buttsex is a bad habit, not a life style.
Whats it like living in 1912?
With all the nasty old STDs that are now drug resistant the libidinous are going to learn about chastity the hard way. A shot won't fix it anymore.
Couldn't agree more. Great comment!
Obama immediately called the Commander of the ship to ask him about the status of the transgender bathrooms.
That wasn't even a good try gomer.
Harvey died of HIV. So did his partner, I believe.
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Harvey was shot by a co-worker who hated gays. Even a quick google search would show that. But perhaps you prefer lying?
hahahahahahahaha
He was shot by a political rival Democrat.
who didn't get the bathroom heel clicking
Talking about Republican Larry Craig?
So you believe made up stories.... thanks for sharing that.
I pity the sailors that are assigned to the ship.
The Iranians will just throw it off of a building when their patrol boats capture it
Welp, I guess this is the end of the US Navy as history has known it previously. It used to be a place where young boys went to learn how to be men. Now I guess it's a place where young gay boys go to meet other young gay boys. We must be a laughing stock.
I don't know about "we," but I'll agree that you're a laughing stock.
Its still the same Navy. Stop being a drama queen.
Did the Village people sing at the naming. LOL What a joke.
Yeah that was a big black eye for the Navy when the Village People filmed a homoerotic video on one of their destroyers.
Nothing like a good gay article to bring out the "conservative" dinosaurs. The beauty is - conservatives lost. On gay rights, on your candidates, on everything that counts. Because extremist conservatives are a hate fringe group. Nothing more.
GFY!!
I know. Great isn't it.
Remember Greece and those gays in the second century BC....you regressives .
Remember christians and the Roman Empire? When christians took over, the empire fell.
That's not even factually accurate lol WTH are you even talking about
I beg to differ. The Hillary supporters are one huge hate group.
So that means you support pedophiles? Way to go lol You must be so proud
Gay Rights don't count- sorry!
Gays are hetero phobic.
This is so sad. I can't believe how much our country has imploded in the past eight years. Unfortunately, it looks like more of the same coming up.
Sure you don't want to go back any further? I am sure this didn't start in the last 8 years, but I see what you're trying to do.
So this guy was in the Navy and gay. But because he was "really gay" and outspoken we named a Fu_kin ship after him?
and he was a pedo
Makes me glad I didn't serve aboard a tanker.The USN has really gone down hill.
As a Navy Veteran I find this deplorable! What happened to the U.C.M.J. that we were held accountable too? I guess when Bill Clinton came in office and implemented "Don't Tell, Don't Ask" any thing that had to do with homosexuality or beastity went out the window. And now with Obama in office ANYTHING goes. Our once great Country has turned into a cesspool of Liberals.
Liberals who won't serve honorably.
Like Trump.
Like Clinton
Back then women didn't serve in the military much.
Chelsea can
Clintons
I could care less about billy boy, he isn't running.
in the shadows
Your tinfoil hat has slipped off and the rays are getting in again.
- We're not talking about Trump, we're talking about you f*ggots.
We've never needed someone to make America Great Again more so than right now.
But Trump isn't a religious fanatical conservative. Do you think he really cares about the anti-gay agenda?
Brought to you by William Jefferson Clinton.
Perhaps they can use it as a target ship for torpedo trials.
these are the people leading us. people who would light up the white house with the gay flag. people who want our country invaded by sharia law pushing islamists. Obama hated this country and only served to turn it around toward destruction
No, I think Obama thought he would make this country in his own image.
Milk has sexual relations with multiple male enlisted men and is forced out of the Navy with a less than honorable discharge. His reward for his unacceptable conduct is he gets a ship named after him for his political activities in San Francisco. No wonder our military is in such a mess.
Navy Secretary Ray Mabus; LMAO!
America is fast becoming a failed state.
So get out, traitor.
How is Eyeseeit a traitor ?
GFY!
Correction; IS a failed state.
So get out, traitor.
Who are you?
I woke up in a Soho doorway, a policeman knew my name. He said "You can go sleep at home tonight if you can get up and walk away." I slipped back to the Underground and the breeze blew back my hair. I remember throwing punches around and preaching from my chair. Well, who are you?
I sure you"ll enjoy; G.F.Y.
Thanks for admitting you lost this argument.
The only thing lost here is your manhood and dignity.Mine is very much in tact,Fudgepounder.
Aww, how adorable! You're so sure you've lost the argument, you're upping the ante on the rude insults. How very sad.
So long,Fairy.
combat vet,Mekong.Honorable Discharge,Purple Heart,etc.etc.What's been YOUR service to America,Pogeybait ?
To all the lying liberals who keep saying he was Honorably discharged. Britannica.com/biography/Harvey-Milk Not according to Harvey he wasn't.
And military records don't support his claim. Like any politician he was pandering for sympathy and votes.
Sorry, Navy, but this is just wrong! There must be numerous homosexuals who have served our country with distinction and not been given a "less than honorable" discharge. The ship could have been named after one of them.
Or at least ones that didn't openly brag about their pedophilia exploits
He was honorably discharged. Go to the United States Naval Institute site and read for yourself.
I will. So, you are saying the the AP is incorrect on that.
Yes I am. Have fun.
Interestingly, I find both comments on various site. Honorably and less than honorable. I will hope that the Navy has better presence of mind than naming a ship after someone with a "less than"
That is indeed what the article on the USNI web says. It is not unusual for the AP to be wrong... but usually it favors causes such as this. But, if he was indeed honorably discharged, I apologize to him and withdraw my objection to the ship naming.
I really wish there was more info on his Discharge Type as that has fueled a lot of derisive comments, but I have to default with USNI as they are pretty good with getting it right. They also provide info on the article's author at the bottom. Now all that aside, the Navy could have chosen a different vessel than an oiler. The jokes from that will be going around for decades.
after you pay the $40 to access it I will
are you talking about?
This is what happens when you politicize the military and make a social experiment out of it.
The comments below (and above) are exactly WHY it is appropriate to name the ship after someone who stood up for civil and human rights.
And by stood up, you mean kneel in front of a 13 year old boy...
Or behind...
Ever heard of the republican icon Mark Foley?
No, did someone name a boat after him?
Try bobbling him and asking. You are the expert on pedophiles (experience counts).
Short answer is, No. They didn't name a boat after him like they are doing for this pedophile.
But who was given a "less than honorable" discharge from the very Navy who is naming the ship after him. I guess THAT doesn't count
I don't disagree with your point of view about the comments, but I can tell you this. If we had people at the top who understood the military because they had served, or had other alliances with it, we would not have such controversial issues.
Our Commander in Chief is on the record as supporting and honoring known pedophiles. When will people say enough already?
Your obsession with pedophilia tells me you are a pedophile. Please seek help for your sickness.
Please stick to your day job.........babysitting your mom's basement.
I get it, you can't defend your pedophilia, so you're lashing out. Get help.
You giving out a psychological diagnosis and/or advice is the equivalent of a monkey solving a puzzle for a banana.
Did you enjoy the banana?
Were you trying to make a gay reference? Or call me a monkey....in which case, you were, AGAIN using my post to try and attack. You really are incapable of coming up with any original thought..
Are you really so dense you couldn't figure out what I was saying? I doubt you even got the banana. Poor sad thing!
So demonizing pedophilia is worse than naming naval ships after a known pedophile? Please explain
Another one who is obsessed with pedophilia. Keep your kids away from @dinsmo81. Sick and dangerous.
Well,your mental identity is very much open to question,given your postings;right ?
What kind of Commander in Chief would allow this to happen?
I love rhetorical questions. We all know what kind
May God send it to the bottom of the sea. Disgusting.
"Milk's career as a Navy officer, however, ended with an "other than honorable" discharge," Yup! That's the kind of person we should be naming ships after. And my comment has nothing to do with his preferences, just his performance as a Navy officer. But apparently his preferences have more to do with a ship being named after him than his performance.... as far as the Navy is concerned.
As a Navy Veteran, I hope that they painted a target on the hull....
If you were a Veteran you would not say that. Why would you want a bunch of kids put in harms way that had no say in the matter?
technically, they do. They just may not be in the military anymore if they speak out.
If you were a Navy Veteran you would understand what GOTRUMPFORAMERICA means by his comments. Naming a ship after a gay that was discharged under other than honorable conditions shows how sick our government and country is.
The next one will be Margaret Sanger
SS Sandusky
Does the ship only go in reverse?
It comes with a pitcher, and a catcher mode
This will strike fear in our enemies....! They will be afraid they will be rear ended by a ferry boat...
wellsaid
Are they also going to paint it PINK, color a big brown A55hole by the rudder and paint DIX on the guns ? ? Unfrigginbelievable.
Man it with gays and send to cruise the shores of Iran.....A real threat to their Evinrude navy. Who's going to engineer and make the condom it has to be wrapped in?
Wow... Loss of words.
I am truly scared of this country now. What have we become? I am not doubting this person may be seen as a person to be recognized for his contribution in history but to name a US Navel Ship this is insane. This country would rather name a ship after a gay right activist then a person of the military maybe a person who died defended America. I am sorry but this is just wrong. It is not the place for reconnection. I don't have an issue with gay's as my grandson is gay but I refuse for them to have more clout then everyone else. A person who is gay should not define them. I think it is respectful to recognize that many have differences but not to award these differences as a power tool. Maybe they should name a ship after my husband who spent 7 1/2 years in the US Navy from 1960-1967.
How does naming a ship after him give gays more clout as you say? The navy decided to name this class of ship after people making significant contributions to civil and human rights. Milk did that for the gay community. There are many other classes of ships named after military personnel.
Did your husband become an activist fighting for the equal treatment of others?
Funny to watch a bunch of Cons who never served criticizing a man who served honorably.
Serving up BJ's to little boys isn't "serving honorably"
I agree, so why do you keep doing it?
He was a self admitted pedophile.
than honorably..read the article queerbait..
Oh, an article on Fox couldn't possibly be wrong. That's hilarious!
Why do you keep lying? He was discharged dishonourably.
Why do YOU keep lying?
See I provide my sources. You just lie.
You are probably in denial about a lot of things. No surprise there. You're broken. Sad.
I JUST provided you a source. Britannica.com/biography/Harvey-Milk According to Britannica AND Harvey, he received a dishonourable discharge.
Is the baby still crying? Aw, don't cry, baby. Mommy will come to change your diaper.
LoL That's what I thought. You get shown that you're supporting a pedophile and you got nothing to say. But like I said, that's what we expect from your ilk.
Poor thing, your hatred has melted your brain. Assuming there was a brain to begin with. But it's fun making you dance like a monkey on a chain. Dance, monkey!
I'm currently serving so take your little smirk and shove it. He didn't serve honorably, which is why he got an other than honorable discharge.
Sure you are, buddy. Sure you are.
Keep living in denial chickensh!t. I'm totally not sitting in my flightsuit getting ready to go to base. You are so right. You are such a smart little Libby keep telling yourself that you special little flower.
Hope the pos sinks with all of her don't ask, don't tell sailors on board.
Wishing the death of US military personnel? Sounds like treason to me!
What would you know about service or treason?
The USS Qeerbarge
Is it really a Navy ship, or just the San Francisco Bay Fairy?
lol
Honoring pedophiles is long overdue. Does it have to be liberal pedophiles or do other ones get boats too?
Yeah, you Cons made a pedophile Speaker of the House! You must be so proud!
That was water-carrying republicans. No conservatives were involved.
LOL.. sure honey.
When name-calling starts, you have lost
Nope, when you put a pedophile two heartbeats away from the Presidency, you've lost. Nice try, though.
I agree we have lost, but it was no speaker who destroys our military. It is Barack Obama and his employers.
You are such a drama queen. The military is not "destroyed".
I don't believe you have any right to judge the military. When did you serve?
From 1990 to 2012.
sure
I don't believe you should have made a pedophile Speaker of the House, but you seem to be fine with that. Sad.
Proof the Navy has a sense of humor. I can here it now. U.S.S. Milk full of seaman enter San Francisco.
Judge Napolitano, I must correct you on a talking point I just watched you state on Fox Extra. Your point that South Carolina should remove the Confederate Flag from the State House is wrong, and it surprises me that you failed to do the proper research. The state legislature removed the Confederate Flag from the State House on 1 July 2000. It was then placed BEHIND the Confederate War Memorial on State House grounds to honor the troops from SC who fought for the Confederacy, right where it belongs. In the future, PLEASE do your research before spouting off like a liberal.
The flag means different things to different people, especially people that do not live in the south and do not understand southerners or their heritage. I have no hate for any race, I try to avoid ticking off others by using racial comments in public just as I try to avoid cussing at the office. But don't understand how 13% of the population can tell the rest of us that we have to believe what they believe, and we cannot honor our ancestors who fought the North in the civil war by flying a flag on our private residence if we choose to. Two weeks ago I started flying both the American flag as well as the confederate battle flag daily. Don't like it, make your opinions known from the street, touch my flag and I'll defend my possessions as its attached to my house. Since I started flying it, 5 other neighbors have started flying theirs as well. All of which used to fly the American flag on flag day, holidays, and anytime it felt right to do so, now they all fly the Rebel flag(battle flag) as we feel we are under attack, not from minorities who live in the south, but once again from activists from the North, forcing their opinions and rules and regulations on us where they have no right to do so. I am rebelling against that in the easiest way I can, by flying a flag that I have displayed on my first car for 40 years, and flying the flag of my College, and the confederacy...regardless if it lost a war or not. The North cannot abolish southern values or heritage, even if they want to protest our government buildings, try it in the suburbs and see what type of response you get.
You lost me when you brought god into it.
I wish we had Napolitano on the US Supreme Court! Great article.
I wonder why the author did not stand up for the rights of those who support international hate groups such as islamic terrorist. Where does he stand on terrorist like ISIS recruiting via social media.
No I couldn't even finish reading this because it is wrong at the base and it is wrong throughout.. You should really do some research on the different flags there are that are similar.
The Stars and Bars is a symbol of souther heritage.
Are they removing the Black Panthers colors or just the stars and bars.
The Left insists that Americans recognize racism today and acknowledge its stain on our history. We already do this daily, from private discussions to national conversations (Ferguson, Baltimore), motion pictures (12 Years a Slave, Selma), and even Black History Month. To that end, Democrats should stop flinging their Confederate flag onto the Grand Old Party. Instead, knock-kneed Republicans should steel themselves for once and demand that Democrats concede that they invented this intimidating standard and deployed it for more than a century to keep blacks down.
The Flag did not keep blacks from being successful, they did it to themselves. They have more opporiturity than most white people today and its been over thirty years. Most blacks will never be successful, they do not have the drive to push forward, they want something for nothing.
Former governor Howard Dean (D., Vt.) told the Democratic National Committee in 2003 that “white folks in the South who drive pickup trucks with Confederate-flag decals on the back ought to be voting with us.” That November, Dean declared: “I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks.” Two years later, he became chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
I think you've missed the point of his comments. "Missing the point" seems to be a common theme with you.
As a Democratic governor, Bill Clinton in 1987 signed Act 116, which concerned his state banner. It read: “The blue star above the word ‘ARKANSAS’ is to commemorate the Confederate States of America.”
Democratic activists General E. Lee adopted the flag as his national symbol in 1863
Who is E. Lee? Is he famous or something?
Robert E Lee, confederated General, leader of the confederated army. Did you study history?
What he was pointing out...which evidently you were not bright enough to pick up on...is that the first poster missed the "Robert" in Robert E Lee.
< an example of progressives making sure everyone is doing exactly what the left says is PC. GFY, I'm sure you understand very well what those letters mean, right gruber?
Not politically correct, just correct. There is no general E. Lee. Calling people names like "gruber", shows you are an immature child. Grow up.
I firmly support the right of Southerners, rednecks, Republicans, and other miscellaneous halfwits to fly the Confederate flag. I particularly support it and encourage it during election years. Please, fly the flag and let minority voters exactly what you think of them. Your help in encouraging these people to vote will be doing your country a tremendous service.
The Confederate Battle Flag to me represents to me the willingness to stand up to an obsessive Federal Government that enforces its will through violent force. No state ever surrendered its Sovereignty under the Unites States Constitution. During the Philadelphia debates that was one of the main issues. The states ONLY surrendered 18 power that the Federal Government of the newly formed REPUBLIC would have the power to enforce. Also didn't South Carolina have the oldest Constitution that predates the US Constitution. Now that basically means that the Confederate Battle Flag represents standing up to tyranny and oppression of a tyrannical government. The war for independence from British Oppression was fought for the same reason as the civil war. The civil war was not fought over slavery...it was fought over the belief that the federal government did not have the authority to dictate to the states...(minus a constitutional admin.) Slavery was wrong and terrible blight on our past. The Confederate Battle Flag is part of our history and our southern heritage.
The Federal Government violates the constitution left and right. Read the Judge's piece, "Imagine America without the Constitution" to see just a few clear examples. Our nation was intended to be one of numerous separate sovereign States, yielded limited authority to a central government for the purpose of patrolling the coasts for piracy, minting currency, and other things that a Federal government would be able to do more efficiently than all the States separately. Lincoln would undoubtedly role over in his grave if he would have seen how the Federal Government would have used the Civil War to strip states of their rights and powers… The Federal government just votes itself more power year after year.
Silly people with silly ideas - Yep that flag means something.
That and slavery.
Just flag this soros paid troll as spam. It's that time of month so emotions is all it has to operate on. Gruber
He is correct, and any that call anyone "gruber" is clearly a child. Grow up. If you have something to refute, refute it.
None of these Liberals understand that Judge because they are the ones who infiltrate the Government. This is what happens when you let people in illegally, take people in from hostile to America areas and when you let people like Vallerie Jarrett, Barack Obama or Van Jones head departments that impact people. Liberal fantasy playing a dangerous game with reality....
Hispanic people = SC will take down its Confederate flag? That's a new one.
There you go thinking again. Please, leave it to people equipped and qualified to do it correctly.
I say change the name of Fort Bragg (who was a traitor) to Fort Sherman as a reminder to all confederates. Don't make us burn down your cities again.
On April 4, 1818, a plan was passed by Congress in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars, with a new star to be added when each new state was admitted, but the number of stripes would be reduced to 13 so as to honor the original colonies. ● 10 million+ Estimated number of Native Americans living in land that is now the United States when European explorers first arrived in the 15th century ● Less than 300,000 Estimated number of Native Americans living in the United States around 1900 4 Million Slaves in 1860 who granted had a bad 100+ years even after slavery "ended", or dropping a continents entire population to 0.3% of it's original number.... Maybe we should be more concerned with the atrocities done to the natives of America. Maybe they should be slightly more offended by the flag flying over the White House. Many people who love the constitution would prefer the Gadsen Flag (Don't Tread on Me) replace the old, clearly offensive, stars and bars design anyway. Hug an ancestor of a slave. Cry for an ancestor of an actual native of the continent we all strive to make a better home for all of us.
You do know the vikings come here before the asians crossed the land bridge right?
As much as 25% of the DNA of the North Eastern North American natives was European in origin. How many hundreds of years and what percentage of their DNA before they were considered native by you sir? Or are we all only native to Africa? 125,000 to 60,000 years isn't that long really is it...
Genetics has proven that information to be outdated. I would suggest a Nova series called the First Ones. It will fill you in on the latest information we have gotten from genetics.
In the real world, God gives us freedom to suffer the consequences of our inappropriate words and deeds.
God also gives us the freedom to bask in our words and deeds regardless of what others may think about them!
God is , as always, whatever you imagine it is.
So who's responsible for the incredible list of misdeeds done by our government? You? Me? Or is it that America is great because no one takes responsibility for any misdeeds... Well unless you can only afford a public defender.
Mentioning "god" and the real world together is an oxymoron.
Confederate flag represents resistance to federal authority enforced by military aggression : That is where I have stood with the flag.
AMEN! But that doesn't serve Liberal propagandist agenda.
All this diversity training everyone has had to go thru over these many years was supposed to fix the waty people felt about race. Yep quota laws would help.....political correctness was going to help.....I don't know all of them, but the results can be seen on news clips of Ferguson and Baltimore..............can't they?
Another name for "diversity training" is to brow beat one group until you can create even more who didn't previously but now thoroughly hate you for eternally dissing them.
Your religion ends where my nose begins. If you want a caliphate as the basis for government move to Iran. Good riddance!
Isis is destroying all remnants of middle eastern heritage and religion that does not support sharia law. This is the left's equivalent action here in America
Nonsense. Grow up.
< nonsense? please explain the difference, we're all waiting to hear you deliver an intelligent response........ still waiting......
Now we are fighting over a flag? Some Indians are against the American flag. Where does all this end?
True, more hate, more carnage, more destruction has been done under the Stars and Stripes than under the Confederate battle flag. Japenese incarcerated, and even some Germans. Native Americans wiped out almost, the rest placed on forced marches to rival the Bataan death march in WW2. Remember Trail of Tears and women giving birth or having miscarriages along the way, marched every day across hundreds of miles. Deliberately infected blankets with smallpox given to old men, women, children, in order to wage germ warfare against them. Deliberate bombing of civilian centers in Germany and Japan instead of only industrial targets. Thousands wiped out in a fiery holocaust in just 2 days in Hiroshima and Nagasaki using atomic weapons. Yes, if there's a flag that should be retired because it's displayed hate and excess of bloodshed it's the Stars and Stripes. When placed beside that record, the Stars and Bars comes off looking almost saintly.
People in India are against the American flag?
Foxxy is my kind a lady
so if FOX thinks racist hate speech should be protected why is FOX so up in arms about ISIS hate speech and should their flag be protected too?
Yes their flag should be protected Beheading people and pushing them.off buildings is not speech.
Obama has one.
"The State has no business expressing opinions on anything, and it is required to protect ha te" At least he's consistent. Remember, Judge Napolitano is the one who, in an April 2015 O'Reilly interview, defended the AFDI who wanted to post advertisements caIIing for the kiIIing of Jews.
FREEDOM is HILARIOUS to some. A necessity to others. Our forefathers believed in certain inalienable rights... Many of us do not laugh at people like you who would pursue perceived safety at the cost of our freedoms. We BELIEVE in the Bill of Rights.
There are no such things as inalienable rights.
There is NO entity in America that will ever oppress my 1st Amendment right which also includes any individual in government office. Obama, by ordering retail outlets to stop sales of a flag has become a domestic enemy of the 1st Amendment.
You think the President "ordered" five separate retailers to stop selling fIags? What a nutter.
He probably did, Muzzy
Obama is demanding the erasure of American history by funneling hate. The Nazis did exactly the same thing and over 6 million people died. Make no mistake, the Democratic national Communist agenda is to socialize America and oppress the Constitution.
YES, it is. Obama hates this country and our freedom and is intentionally destroying it.
exactly.
Why the lies?
< why the ignorance?
It sure looks that way
6 million? try 100 million. 30-40 million in USSR alone.
The confederate flag is the least of America's problems.
Right on.
The Washington Redskins are just happy the attention has moved on to rebel flag.
Hate gets a bad rap. We were given the ability to make judgements. I hate violence against the weak, I hate coffee, I hate House (Hugh Lorry is terrible.) Embrace your hate. You have a human right to it. The real hate is shutting down free speech
Oh, come on, he's not that bad.
Funny, some people cannot see why Blacks are offended by the confederate flag. It just amazes me. The whole purpose of the confederacy and its constituiton was to allow the continued enslavement of Black people. No state could be apart of the confederacy unless they allowed the practice of slavery. If you do not believe that, then I strongly urge you to read both the US and confederate constitution. The whole purpose of the civil war was to continue the horrible act of slavery in the south. With that, I say now to take the rag down and put it in a museum.
It's shocking how many people just argue it is southern pride. No it is not. You can be proud of where you are from without displaying a flag that reminds people of the horrible attrocities their ancestors lived through.
barker @br782 @flrlegal If it was their ancestors that lived thru it, then they get to choose whether to acknowledge it or not. Why is it your business?
barker @flrlegal The "whole purpose" was not slavery, and the vast majority of those who fought for the South did not own slaves. Many were ambivalent with respect to it. But, what drove the conflict most was the idea that the States were not subservient to the United States, and had a contractual right to withdraw from it. New York was the first to test this during the first "civil war" of 1812, when NY's legislature drafted articles of succession. Had the Brits decided to back off after burning D.C., NY and other Eastern States may have tried to leave the Union. The Southern States might have said "good riddance". The issue of the Confederacy certainly contained the ongoing issue of slavery, but its primary issue was "States rights", a battle that continues to this day.
barker @flrlegal Whatever other issues were involved do not matter. In 2015 we remember it as slavery. So the confederate flag is now associated with slavery. That is why it must go.
barker @flrlegal not we, you. That's what it means to you.
barker @flrlegal I will fly it from now on, I will not be a slave to the PC police.
Treason is as treason does , pull down and burn that no good rebel flag. It's not a god given right to side with treason,freedom of speech is a Constitutional Right.....God did not sign the Constitution ,MEN signed that document in spite of both the Crown and the Church of England. You can have your so called divine right and your divine might our government has neither and never shall. It will always be obedient to the Citizens of the United States or else.
Treason is as treason does, your right our goverment is full treason. Trying to give our enemy a nuke.
Obama is a traitor and belongs in prision.
Bush first. He is an international war criminal.
barker @mc6521 Try again after you sober up! Have you ever heard the term "inalienable rights"? When you are sober, tell us what you think it means.
: Son, I'm going to give you some words of advice. I'll ask you to heed them, please: LAY OFF THE CAFFIENE!.Any questions... don't ask 'em.
barker @Telesia2 @mc6521 Ha! I like your response better than mine!
Incomprehensible, inaccurate and wacky.
One minute you claim to believe in Freedom of Speech. The next you want to silence speech you do not agree with... IN THE SAME POST. Freedom of speech is about ALL speech being free. Not just the speech you like or agree with. Wow.
I find it funny that people are talking about freedom of speech. Nobody said you can't fly a flag at home. They are just saying the state government shouldn't do it.
So what are your thoughts on affirmative action?
Not a huge fan - state by state issue.
Me neither
Very few people are anymore.
Our government has three branches: Legislative, Executive, and Judicial. The First Amendment only talks about what Congress can do. There's nothing in the Constitution about the Executive or Judicial branch not limiting speech, and those branches do it routinely when it serves their interest. Stop perpetuating myths foxbots.
Very incorrect - the First Amendment applies to citizens - not any branch of Government.
You need a refresher course.
And I think you need high school.
Not to mention there is no freedom of speech issue here at all
Freedom of speech is a myth. Few seem to understand that the First Amendment does not confer ANY absolute right of free speech. What it does is place a limit on the power of one branch of government to control speech, the legislative branch. And even that limit is more myth than reality.
That's not true. The First Amendment applies to all citizens. It does not apply to any branch of the Government.
Proof that American public schools need to teach civics.
"Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech..." I believe the other 2 branches to clearly be implied. Why don't you?
You think that flag is terrible and it is. these politicians need to do something with the isis flag full of hate. they have taken thousand's of innocent lives in the last couple years. Under the isis flag they are killing as we speak. People stop thinking about yourselves and what happen a hundred years ago. Open your eyes and look at today. Pray for your brothers and sisters in Christ that our politicians will stop the genocide.
that flag is no more terrible than YOU are
how am I terrible huh
I do know you talk like a nut job. nobody is flying isis flags here. you are in the wrong country
yes they are where you been
I am right here and I don't see any. some of my neighbors fly the confederate flag though
it flying high here thats why Americans are joining Isis
now whos the nut job
You are wrong. Get educated and find out the truth. There have been people flying it. Very sick.
The ISIS flag isn't flying from any state Capitol buildings, is it?
barker @CarpeNoctem Not yet! And, given Obama is a lame duck...we may be safe for a while
barker @CarpeNoctem Don't count on it.
it flying high here thats why Americans are joining Isis
Keep traveling in this same direction and it will!
If Obama has his way, it WILL be flying from all 57 of them.
barker @justme33355 @CarpeNoctem Too funny!!!!!
Why can't we look at both issues?
i do i just said both flags are terrible
Protecting hatred preserves hatred. GOP/FOX spin team must be commended for continually massaging narratives to suit their angle.
You are falling in to communism and we will fight you . we will never give in to it
barker @DemocracyManifest You miss the whole point, you "intellectual lightweight". Freedom is about protecting speech..whether or not YOU like what is being said!!
So, you object to the 1st Amendment?
yes communists try to shut you up any way they can. the political correctness is the start of it
My angle is do not tread on me and I will not tread on you. Try to take my GOD given rights and you best bring a lot of back up!
We have freedom of speech. That means all speech, not just speech that you agree with.
Remove the flag, everything Im not so sure about. I always enjoy Napolitano. He is usually spot on, and unbiased.
As a white southerner - there is nothing wrong with southern pride. But we should not be flying a flag that reminds all African Americans that our relatives once owned their Great or Great Great grandparents Every time they see this flag they are reminded that white America used to own their relatives as property. Why on Earth should we keep perpetuating this??
Good point.
That's ridiculous.
How on earth is that ridiculous?
She doesn't know.
How can you know what is in another one's thoughts?
Ah, so you know he's right. Figures.
So you would be ok with your government flying the flag of a group that kidnapped your grandmother and used her as a slave?
(not to mention a flag whose SOLE PURPOSE was as that of an enemy state)
Another good point.
Enemy state? Tells me you not only do not know your country's history you also are not up on why the states felt that they could secede.
The USA has paid dearly and still does for that smudge in history, but these types of actions perpetuate racism, keeps it alive. I guess liberals are the true white apologists.
I agree. Flying a flag that symbolizes racism perpetuates racism. Time to take it down.
what flag is that? confederate flag never internationally promoted racism, slavery maybe but it also represents southern patriotism...
Yeah, you're right. The flag representing a people defending slavery in no way represents any racism. If you want to demonstrate your American patriotism in the south, FLY AN AMERICAN FLAG! Not the flag of an enemy state.
I am very proud of the America Flag. Maybe you need to learn some more about what occurred under this flag since the first day it was raised. You really should stop being so melodramatic, not becoming at all.
Really? "Smudge in history." Kidnapping thousands and enslaving them is not a "smudge." I am southern and I have pride without ever having touched that racist flag. It is extremely hateful and should have been retired (well, it was before the civil rights movement) years ago.
I'm not understanding this kidnapping point. Be real. Other countries took by force their own people and sold them for a coin. Stop attempting to portray this country as being the only one that participated in this evil trade.
Yes, there are LOTS of countries that have been and are far worse. There are still lots of slaves in the ME and Africa.
See you don't have a clue, the grandmother was nabbed by her own people and sold to slave traders(not from America), the best were sold in S America, the scag was sold in America.
It's amazing to me that you all think the fact that some blacks owned slaves somehow makes it all ok. By the way; you were the last to know.
It is a fact that many blacks owned many slaves. That does not make it okay, but neither does it make white ownership any worse. There are still many blacks owning slaves today, just not here.
Your lack of knowledge is astounding.
Kidnapped? How about that flag where the same grandmother could be lynched or kept from ordering and eating a hamburger next to a white person? Where does this end with removing of all things offensive?
Liberals want to remove EVERYTHING that THEY do not agree with, including the Constitution.
Did you miss the point of the article? This isn't about what we "should" do. It is about unlawfully restricting that which we have a right to do.
I must have missed the case where a state prevented an individual from flying a confederate flag on their own property.
Thats just people trying to spin it like its being ban.
Typical Fox.
Until we get back to survival of the fittest, we will continue to become weaker. The wolves are at the gate. They're just waiting for us to tear it down ourselves.
Testing 123
Using income as a way to diversify a student body is an alternative to race-based admissions, but only if the college has a strong endowment and a commitment to financial aid. One of the most respected colleges in the country, Haverford College, just announced that they are no longer need-blind in their admissions process due to budgetary concerns. There are very few colleges truly equipped to fund low-income students in a way that doesn't saddle them with debt for the rest of their lives. If income is the new strategy to create diversity, colleges need to do a better job of making the cost of an education more affordable. And, that seems unlikely at most institutions
Collage and University admissions already favors the disadvantaged. Can anyone name another item whose price for the exact same item is determined by one's ability to pay?
Looks like one of the moderators didn't like one of my prior posts, so censored it. I will try again, From the Princeton website :"Princeton's no loan policy has made it possible for most students to graduate with no debt. For seniors who borrowed, the average total indebtedness at graduation was $6,600." From the Harvard website: We follow two key principles: ● Admission to Harvard is need-blind, meaning your financial need will not impede your chances of admission. ● Aid is based entirely on need, not merit. ● Our generous financial aid program—bolstered by the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which seeks to increase low- and middle-income students’ awareness of Harvard’s affordability—aims to make Harvard accessible to any student who is admitted. ● 20% of our parents have total incomes less than $65,000 and are not expected to contribute. Families with incomes between $65,000 and $150,000 will contribute from 0-10% of their income, and those with incomes above $150,000 will be asked to pay proportionately more than 10%, based on their individual circumstances. Families at all income levels who have significant assets will continue to pay more than those in less fortunate circumstances.
A WHITE MAN WHO IS A WAR VETERAN- WITH A YOUNG WHITE DAUGHTER WHO NEEDS A LIFE SAVING OPERATION - STUDIES FOR 20 YEARS TO BECOME A SCIENTIST, AND A NON WHITE WOMAN FROM A WEALTHY FAMILY FROM COMMUNIST CHINA WHO HAS STUDIED FOR 1 YEAR TO ATTEMPT TO BECOME A SCIENTIST, BOTH ENROLL AT THE SAME COLLEGE AND SHE IS ACCEPTED OVER HIM DUE TO THE MARXIST AFFIRMITIVE ACTION LAW. WHEN HE RETURNS HOME AND HIS DAUGHTER ASKS WHY HE WAS TURNED AWAY FROM THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MONEY FOR HER OPERATION, WHICH HE STUDIED HARD FOR HE HAS TO TELL HIS DAUGHTER IT IS BECAUSE HIS SKIN IS THE SAME COLOUR HIS DAUGHTER'S IS. AND MARXIST CLINTON SUPPORTS THIS LAW.
I INTENDED TO TYPE "BOTH APPLY AT THE SAME COLLEGE", NOT "BOTH ENROLL AT THE SAME COLLEGE".
Bad example dude...Asians in particular get no affirmative action break. Google it! Asians are getting screwed by government policy.
In 1975 I couldn't get a job in Bellingham Washington. Everywhere I went, 6 of the major companies to which I applied, had multiple openings, but I didn't qualify for any of them. Oh, I had the education and I had the experience, but what I didn't have? I didn't have the correct ethnic background! I was Caucasian with no "diversity" (code for minority) status. At the "Unemployment Office", as it was called at the time, many of the people with the correct "diversity" were standing in line to receive their Unemployment checks. As I got up to the counter I asked why so many "people of color" didn't apply at the industries I had applied to for a job. I stated each company by name and the number of positions open and asked why these people couldn't go to work to fulfill the "quota" so I could take a position with one of the companies I had listed. The person behind the counter was a "person of color" and her response was short and to the point. I needed to move along so the next person could receive their benefit check. Jobs, education and now wealth are to be "adjusted" to match the outcome desired of the population of The United States of America! That my friends is Socialism! Since the government Establishment could not push legislation to make all people "equal" the SCOTUS has taken up the challenge and will dictate that design! God help us all!
Been there... in the 70's i worked temp jobs from factories gas stations digging ditches to landscaping & self employment multiple refusals for decent jobs that stemmed from the fact that good companies had a quota & reserved jobs for minorities, refusals for educational grants, scholarships & loans, while my visible & gender minority peers received full rides(even though many were far better off than I, and over 40 years in the workforce living with affirmative action, minorities in supervision edicts, diversity initiatives, inclusive initiatives, women in non traditional roles... ... ... the government cant legislate equality all it can do is discriminate against certain demographics and it has done that with flying colors(no pun intended) look at any state or local government they are (at least where I live dominated by minorities far above their respective % in society the same goes for construction work and the service industry... … We are no longer a free country.
"Last year the Cooke Foundation awarded the $1 million Cooke Prize for Equity in Educational Excellence to Vassar College for its excellent record of admitting, supporting and graduating outstanding low-income students", The key word is "supporting" ... read extra tutoring, mentoring etc. for students who really aren't qualified to begin with.
Yes, because diversity trumps all common sense! Colleges already lower requirements based on parents education and your zip code. My daughter's guidance counselor was honest with us. She said your resume is perfection and beyond compare but you have some strikes against you... you're a white female, with a nice zip code and both your parents graduated from college. You likely won't get into any of these elite schools even though you are more than qualified based on your grades, test scores, recommendations and resume. So sorry honey that your parents were responsible and hard working.
Affirmative action means we get affirmatively second rate doctors and other professionals.
But those professionals that you berate will still have gotten through school, just like all the privileged kids.
Diversity, multiculturalism and racial integration is white genocide period.
every one has a little bit of everyone in their dna.
I thought the Left loved Darwin, that is, the successful succeed rather than the unsuccessful artificially made to succeed. Wait, the successful ensure that others are unsuccessful through various shenanigans. BUT, they are successful because they try rather than spending time and energy on why or why not they succeed! Way too easy to blame lack of success on others. I am left handed and bald, therefore my lack of success is because others stop my success only because of my condition, and has nothing to do with my ability. Just realize that whites happen to succeed, it is a matter of chance not genetics, while others do not. Wait, the 100m track event needs affirmative action! Too many blacks winning, must be racist and needs affirmative action to make whites equally win!
Seriously? The reports also recommend that colleges roll back the athletic admissions preference, because at elite colleges this preference often goes to students playing sports that very few low-income and minority students play – such as crew, water polo, squash and fencing. The Ivy League does not give athletic scholarships to anyone. Any financial awards are based on "need".
"3 percent of students at America’s most selective college and universities come from the 25 percent of families with the lowest incomes, while 72 percent come from the 25 percent of families with the highest incomes." Students who can afford to pay for a better college will now have no advantage over students who don't. Affirmative Action applied to wealth, what's next? Affirmative action applied to...............short people?
so you should have an advantage cause you can pay? not intelligence
If all those terrorist attacks we've been having are just workplace violence, why are there so many police and guards all over Washington? Hmmmm?
This is simply not true: And the reports recommend rolling back the use of early admissions, which are largely unavailable to low-income students who cannot commit going to a school until they know the size of their financial aid package. There is not a single college/university that will force a student to attend if they can not afford to go. All schools put a disclaimer that one can decline they offer if they can not afford to attend.
Hillry's welfare army doesn't really want jobs. They want more freebies.
Another win for the EU union and the takeo of America
Diversity: No white people! LOL
Hmmm? Sacrificing the future of our nation at the alter of diversity, sounds like a the perfect plan for ignorant people to support. MLK would not support this stupidity.
right on!
"If America is to live up to its promise as the land of opportunity" Where is this promise written? I know it's not in the Constitution or the Declaration. The Declaration guarantees "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"
China is the land of equality. That is what communism is for. America is the land of opportunity. That is what democracy is for. You cannot have both.
Discrimination is alive and well in America. We just call it affirmative actions. If discrimination is wrong then reverse discrimination is just as wrong with all Do Respect to the SCOTUS.
There is no "reverse discrimination", there is only discrimination. Liberals invented "reverse discrimination" as a term to imply the origin of all discrimination was created by and practiced only by Caucasians
It needs to get rid of the illegal aliens and deadbeats
White male: most legally discriminated against person in the country
What's next? Affirmative action at the Cadillac dealership because it's racist not everyone can afford a Cadillac?
In America the only qualification you need is to be black, Latino, a woman, or part of the LGBT community. That means white males are the most discriminated demographic in the U.S.
Must be all that "privilege" I keep hearing about
What nonsense. The most qualified candidate should be chosen. Punishing them for being the wrong color is not somehow more progressive. Its the same old racism using different words.
It was a policy developed in response to different times with different problems. Those problems still exist, but they've changed. Perhaps it's time for policy to evolve as well.I'm not sure I agree with every idea discussed in the article, but some of them seem sensible. And in contrast to affirmative action, these policies could achieve the same thing while tending to favor the most qualified candidate, as you say.
No need for affirmative action. Just take race out of the equation and admit students on a number system only; top scores get in. If every college in the country is packed full of Jews, Asians, and white Europeans, so be it.
That's called the Merit System and requires students to actually study and perform. Sometimes it seems minorities think they have somehow "earned" an easier path. Could we call the "Minority Privilege"?
The Supemes have decide discrimination is just fine.....as long as it is reversed
Affirmative action is nothing more than an anti-white racist policy.
They need to start in the high schools that aren't preparing low income student for college.
Affirmative action is discrimination.
So, "Separate but equal" was thrown out by the supreme court. But now it is just fine? Money aside, shouldn't we all have to meet the same standard for enrollment?
If a black leaves high school and can't sign his name or read above a 6th grade level, what makes anyone think he will do any better in college...? Everyone doesn't belong in college. The country needs thousands of burger flippers and broom pushers.
Not just low income unskilled. We need plumbers and mechanics too. You are right college isn't for everyone. Work is.
Trading is the best thing that ever happened to me. I’m a student and I’m proud to say that I’m profiting really well. If you want to learn how to trade and profit from trading. Search Superior Trading System.
What nonsense. The percentage of Hispanics and Blacks actually graduating is dismal. Junior colleges are overflowing because the Blacks and Hispanics are not prepared and junior colleges have to teach them the last two years of high school so they are capable of taking college level classes. Look at the major university graduation data and you will see that Hispanics and Blacks don't get degrees in STEM, they receive degrees in Black Studies and Hispanic Studies. Then the Government has a requirement for quotas of Blacks and Hispanics for any company that provides goods or services for the Government. So we will have small armies of students that know nothing that will be working at US companies. Seems just like the old Soviet Union. The United States has no future.
Maybe that is why the US is 39th in math and science among all civilized countries!

They teach "diversity" in these US Companies.
If you have something to offer other than your misery like excellent grades for example elite universities will give you scholarships.
Lots of kids with excellent grades cannot get scholarships. There aren't that many scholarships. Next time try writing something truthful.
Excellent Grades? So how many 'Straight A' minorities show up for college and can't even handle 12 hrs of Liberal Arts courses?
What exactly is racial diversity? The liberals insist race is just a social construct and that we're really all just alike. So which is it? Do the races differ or not? There is no diversity in diversity if we are all just alike.
We are all alike. However, we are treated differently for political reasons. The dems have to have 'victims' so they can get more voters. It started with blacks, next to woman groups and then to Hispanics. Who is next? Muslims?
What "income diversity" do you mean? High school grads don't have any income. Oh, you mean the income of the PARENTS if such exist. In other words, you intend to reward unproductive or irresponsible parents, and penalize good parents. That's the inevitable result of equal-outcome socialism, it destroys a meritocracy.
If the government subsidizes anything, you re guaranteed to see more of it.
It also creates another problem. If/when implemented unless they include low (and I mean very low) SAT or ACT scores then the color diversity will disappear, thus, ACLU, etc. will file lawsuits that not enough of this color or that color are represented.
The socialists want to increase income diversity, political speak for steal from whites and give to non-whites. I have a better idea. All whites boycott the schools who feel they have to discriminate against whites. See how long all minority schools stay in business !
Just another case of the Supreme Court ignoring the Constitution. What a disgraceful group of knuckleheads.
If the college grading systems weren't biased in favor of the under-represented this whole think might work. Unfortunately, having made the commitment to diversity, professors allow their bias to affect the grading of work that is evaluated subjectively. It is a disservice to the taxpayers paying the freight and the student who wrongly believe they have earned their grades.
Watching college students being interviewed on the streets and asked simple common knowledge questions...."higher education" is a cruelty joke.
It also lowers the standards for achieving!
All College professors be paid 200,00 dollars a week, and then they are still overpaid.
my mom in law got a fantastic green Lexus NX 200t SUV by working part time off of a home.see it here=====JobsBay24.comllllllll
Let's start with that Obama offspring headed to Harvard, do the right thing step down and let a po white kid go instead.
And Wayne University did away with the math requirement and tucked in a class on "diversity." SMH.
They did that because they were losing money. Incoming students couldn't pass a 1+1 = 2 math test.
Don't confuse education for intelligence.
exactly...the words are NOT interchangeable.
How about we just adopt Bernie's Idea and send every student to college after High School where many did poorly already. Set up a jurnior Junior College to teach them first what they failed to learn already. To be sure some dirt poor kids deserve to go to college but not if they blew off HS.
So a far greater group of working poor kids shouldn't get that opportunity because of the small percentage of problem kids you and your ilk focus on.
That's what the GI Bill is for. Assuming that you can graduate HS and stay out of jail, Uncle Sam can get you a free ride.
So much for the smartest and brightess. Lets just keep dumbing down the requirements......Idocracy is only a generation away!
Some are cheating....and are already there
Lets just keep dumbing down the requirements......Idocracy is only a generation away!
It's already here ! Go to any vomit burger and see if the dummy at the register can count the change.
Diversity to the Democrats means a mixed demographic group with identical psychographics. Can you say "thought police".
No, its just a matter of giving a small percentage of kids a chance. Most of the kids going to college will be the same kids that would have gone anyway.
If we stop admitting people into college in the name of diversity who are less qualified to succeed, maybe we can compete on the international stage.
The Japanese have no diversity at all and are way ahead of the US when it comes to academic standards!
it might come as a surprise to many but the white students the biggest beneficiary of quota rules for admission. else we will have far more chinese students in the ivy league universities than is the current state. no sense making waves.
As if they aren't already
We will never stamp out racism if we continually insists on treating people differently based on race.
Not until the Clintons and Obamas of the world are gone.
That's the same thing I say
Socialists don't see it that way. Socialists believe all the "po" folk have to be under control of more socialists !
100 % correct!
Two wrongs don't make a right.
either is doing nothing to fix it
Hum. Students who blew off HS should not be in college. True some poor kid does deserve a shot. But it is a small number.
"Diversity" is liberal speak for ethnic cleansing of white folk
It is my experience that only a few very special students from the "projects" and deepest pockets of non-working families are qualified to enter college, or even be given a GED. Yes, that computes to 3% or so who want to rise above their status in the welfare society. We need to open doors to all who really want to achieve, and make jobs available to others willing to work, regardless of the color of their skin or their origins.
poor white folk is diversity too right???
Whites have to be poorer than everyone else First.
Look what affirmative action did to the USA, Obama!
Affirmative Action is racist.....only the best person should move ahead.....Affirmative Action only brings America down!
Oh my, you just blew LBJ's "war against poverty" out of the water !
People that do well in college are just people that .... do well. Simply attending college will not create people that do well.
All Americans should have the same rules apply to them. It is not justice to give any group special treatment..
I agree
I'm Asian. And can't afford college even though I'm in the upper 1% of my graduating class. As a race, we are by far fewer in number in the general population than Blacks or Hispanics. Yet I don't qualify for Affirmative Action. Why isn't my "diversity" valued the same as other minorities? Why the double standard?
Because affirmative action is by its very nature, racist. It contends that races are superior and inferior. That members of racial groups should be promoted and demoted in an attempt to -- do what?
Murray @insideout26529 From what I've read, some colleges actually put a cap on asian admissions. It seems that test qualifications, or anything else is just ignored. The colleges simply limit the number of asian student population. I'm talking about american asians. The number of foreign asians appears to be an entirely different matter. Colleges appear to welcome them with open arms.
Murray @insideout26529 Probably because they can charge higher tuition to non-nationals. For universities, it is ALL about the buck. Pious hypocrites.
Murray @insideout26529 Yes -- they don't have to offer them financial aid. They pay full price.
If you are actually a highly qualified student, you can find a scholarship and financial aid to attend college, without "Affirmative Action" becoming involved. I think maybe you are just posting some "feelings" not founded on fact.
Consider that the number of scholarships that are available to non-caucasian, non-asian students is much higher than for those two classes. Those scholarships also have lower standards to apply.
Coyote Because by affirmative action they mean black.
If you are Asian you will find a way. Good luck to you.
you mean you can't afford Harvard...
Simple! The dems want as many voters that they can 'buy' as a group. It's all about staying in power. Creating 'victims', political correctness and the welfare system has always been a tool of the left.
Maybe remove the "have you ever been convicted of a felony" question from rental and work applications and I bet that not only will more people stop getting government assistance, crime would also drop.
60% of people believe Sadam responsible for 9/11. People are stupid Or should I say poorly educated
Sierra415 Stop people who never paid into it from collecting it. That would be all the"immigrants" who come here just for social security and welfare, who have never, and will never pay into three system, never contribute anything this country,and never become citizens because they play the system. Socialist!
Are you a Native American?
Benefits are based on wages. No work, no social security. Dah
Not true. Spousal benefits.
Still based on earnings
If people help their old parents instead of Soc Sec. And Medicare we would have surplus
they worked and were forced to pay into SS, what have welfare recipients contributed to except the DEBT
Socialism. And they spend way more than they put in.
yes, they spend more than they put in but not only did they contribute to SS, they also PAID FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. You will never win this argument but keep making your assinine statements.
Our national debt is most all. Soc sec, Medicare, and defense. Look it up poorly educated
They pay taxes and by goods, pay rent and this is very little of the debt. Debt=sis sec , medicare, and defense
blah blah blah, lame and uninformed just like any good little taker.
Facts bother you? And I got my first paycheck at 9 and worked all my life. Never received government check till Soc. sec.
People flag this troll and it will go away
Truth hurts And go get a job
Common sense is out...intellectuals is in....kcaraB amadO
BRAVO!!! Able-bodies adults should have to work for benefits. POTUS Obama gave them a free ride, and asked nothing in return.
Not only should this happen in every state, how about: don't give anyone money. Just have central warehouses for the folks on welfare to pick up good healthy food and diet staples. Then they won't have food stamp fraud opportunities.
Yeah and get rid of Soc Sec. And Medicare. That the biggest expense
I've paid into s.s. for over 37 years. If you want to get rid of it, just pay me back my money with15% interest, compounded quarterly over that time. I'll stop collecting. Socialist!
I paid in longer than that and the lock box is running out. It is a socialist insurance program. Do you like it?
15%? Lots of laughs
It is ironic that banning candy soda and snacks from the poor is punishment , when all of those things lead to ill health and a health burden in the billions among those able to buy their soda, candy, and snacks. I bet it cost more in the long run to pay for the problems created by this eating and "working" life style.
Too many people on the dole. Never before in US history have we had this many folks receiving some form of public assistance. With roughly half the population working and paying taxes this is unsustainable. This is democrat leadership for you.
It depends on how you define public assistance, some consider letting homeowners write off their property tax as public assistance.
" after the requirements largely were suspended by the Obama administration." No wonder blacks vote democrat.
This it what happens in socialist societies. You become a government dependent. The government makes all the rules for you. You have no right to make decisions- you gave that right away when you took the welfare. No candy, cake, pie or soda for you.
I pay federal income taxes. So should DONALD
Donald pays more in federal income taxes in one year than you will pay over your lifetime.
Donald pays more income tax in one month- than the silly liberal poster will pay in his/her/it's entire life time.
Paid 0 in two years we've seen. I don't believe he pays thus no income taxes releases
I have to work if I want to eat, they can too. We need to provide the same service we provide to enlist personnel in the military, barracks, & food. If it's good enough for our soldiers, etc.
So you get food stamps, because you met the work requirement. Unless you are a saying you have a job that pays enough to buy your own food.
Who benefits from the work requirement? The businesses that hire people at a wage that is insufficient, but allows the person to get a subsidy from the State government. The business man is very happy. He can continue to pay less than a living wage with confidence the State will use tax payer money to feed his employees.
Walmart employees get food stamps and Medicaid
But the Walton family is broke
maybe they should have gotten an education or learned a trade.
There is no guarantee in America that you will be automatically paid a LIFESTYLE wage.
No workee no foodie.
Thanks Jesus
Oh boy, BLM type folks ain't gonna like this
Maine followed the Kansas lead in 2014. In the first three months, the number of able-bodied adults without children on food stamps fell by almost 80 percent. Can Chimps read?.. I guess not... if chimps could read then policies would be changed.
Kansas is a financial disaster.
Oh, I'll bet Illinois, New York, and Cali are so much better off with their social/govt. programs?
When they talk about the work requirement for food stamps I always chuckle. I live in California and people with full time jobs qualify for food stamps here. I am not sure what is going on in Mississippi.
One simple way to change the amount of people on foodstamps... switch back to the old food stamp coupons, get rid of the EBT. There used to be a certain guilt and shame associated with being on foodstamps (as there should be for an able-bodied person). Nowadays, to prevent people from having their feelings hurt, we give them EBT cards so that they can hide the fact that they're on the taxpayer dime.
Liberals - we would love to hear the rationale for taxpayers providing sustenance and other expenses paid to people who are capable but unwilling to earn their own keep. Other than the guarantee that those slaves will continue to vote for democrats to keep the freebies flowing their way. Anybody? Bueller? Bueller?
about 200 more days of the stinky chimp boy... He is leaving behind gaping wounds and 20 trillion in stinky chimp dept...
The days of the Silver backs lying around in the streets is coming to an end... and the stinking chimp in the White House is going back up into the canopy...
if trump wins...............
The work requirement should have never been taken off.
People coming here as "refugees" get SSI, Medicaid, TANF, food stamps etc. According to a friend at Catholic Family Services, they receive immediate cash of nearly $2000.00, housing subsidies etc. If you haven't read the Cloward-Piven strategy, you should. Obama's bringing in many thousands of these "refugees" to crash our welfare system.
Refugees, Cubans! Not illegals. Coward Priven is about 50 years old. Right wing propaganda
Notice the Judge in the video just said "The burglar knows you cant throw him in jail for not paying restitution to the person they burglarized because that is Debtors Prison" Stop paying your child support and see if they wont throw you in prison for that! So debtors prison doesn't apply to FELONS but if your a dad down on your luck, YOU"RE GOING TO JAIL! That's how screwed up our justice system is.
The President and Congress should work for the Money the Hard Working Taxpayers are giving them. Then get rid of Food Stamps, Welfare, Medicaid, Illegal Alien Aid, Refugee Aid and Foreign Country Aid.
This is an atrocity! Wanting people to actually work for their handout? What's this world coming to?
Alabama booted 32,000 out of the welfare system, because....gee....apparently working 20 hours a week or volunteering 6 hours a week is just too burdensome.
I would eliminate welfare altogether in its current form.In it's place you show up at the welfare office at 6:00 am sharp. Some care for children at the daycare center, others are given tasks. For each hour worked, minimum wage is paid. Transportation driven by other welfare recipients is provided. Work training would be provided, also at 10 an hour. Bottom line is we need to get back to a world where folks do not get something without giving back.
As long as a single parent can count providing their own daycare as a job, I think this is a great idea.
pathetic
,Get real!

Most people on food stamps do work or they are elderly and disabled
Not true. Millions of phony charlatans are receiving SSI for frivolous "diseases/disorders."
Not true. Very difficult to get SSI. Try it.
The baby mamma is the chief recipient of food stamps.
No.....too many of them are single mothers with multiple kids by multiple baby daddies, milking the system for all it's worth. I know. I have several welfare queens as patients.
Offer family planning!
doesn't work, i can't even count the number of times i've heard people say they don't care if they get pregnant again or have another kid, that's just a pay raise to them.
Not my experience. With family planning the average Welfare family went from 4 to 2 kids.
all i'm saying is i physically hear that all the time. I don't really care if you believe it or not because it doesn't change the fact it is truth so i'm not going to argue the point with you. Also, I'm not saying that what you just said isn't true either but I'd be willing to bet that for every person who attends family planning sessions because they want to improve themselves there's 20 who have no desire to do so and just want to milk the system.
Welfare workers used to take family planning kits on home visits, refer for tubos, and well received. Then the religious nuts stopped that
LMAO! And you seriously believe that?
Yes. Dummie. Do some research
Oh, is that why the govt., who typically slants numbers in their favor, reports billions in fraud? Huh, where is the fraud coming from? Your adult toy purchases?
When I was a growing up, food stamps were for families that went through some kind of horrible disaster - usually widows who suddenly lost their husbands. Today food stamps are given out indiscriminately. Even illegals found ways to get free food- at tax payer's expense.
Never was that
yeh okay! You're prob on welfare right now.
Put them to work cleaning the streets, getting rid of graffiti, improving landscaping.
Russell Wanna fix our crumbling roads? Put some of these people (those capable) to work.
It is a Dept. Of Agriculture program to move their products
Obama is out to make slaves of the working class which I presume is predominantly white.
Russell Should have been required all along.
Mabee some of these people need to eat out of garbage cans .like I did because they refused to give me food stamps because I was single
You should find yourself a baby mamma or two......make a few out of wedlock babies....get custody of them. Then you can get some food stamps!
S. @mastersundholm I got laid off from my job last December. I was making $87,000 a year and my wife only makes $32,000. I tried to go for unemployment in Pennsylvania and was declined because I made too much money. They seriously denied me unemployment because I made too much money at what was my previous job. They said I had to wait 3 months before I would qualify!!! I told them I have no income the day after my last day at work. They still did not care. Getting laid off in December is the worst month to get laid off in. Took me two months to find a job that is making what I was previously. Now because I could not qualify for unemployment I did pick up side jobs with a family member that did residential electrical work. Otherwise my bills would have defaulted.
S. @mastersundholm Saddened by your testimonial. This is the unfortunate world created by this narcissist in office! The system is broke and helping only those he believes need help...
Just remember no trabjo no cervesa
Abolish the IRS & have a consumption tax - Freloaders and the 49% of us that actually work would pay the same. I would get behind that.
But then Trump would have to pay taxes
That sounds like a win win then right? Trump 2016 & 2020!!!
regardless of whatever taxes he may be able to avoid.......sales tax isn't one of them. Unless of course he is buying something in a state that doesn't have one.
I would bet Obama or Hillary would overide any attempt at drug testing and a work program. This is their voters. Only Trump can get us out of this mess right now. Thing is, you can only spend other people's money for so long....when it runs out there will be riots. Plan accordingly... With all of the Middle Eastern Terrorist (99% are on all forms of welfare) that Obama is bringing in to finish his job as the Manchurian Canidate -Cash flow will dry up or one of them detonates a dirty bomb in a pledge to Allah.
If I have to work then people who want to spend my tax money should have to work also. There needs to be a big incentive to work like, "no benefits for you".
make 'em work on farms and take the jobs from illegals.
Start drug testing these lazy moochers
Drug test our Federal and State politicians first.
Stop welfare after eighteen months and provide for those that exceed eighteen months with a facility that prove food ,shelter and medical in army type three story barracks.The residents would be responsible to work in the kitchen ,laundry ,child care center and cleaning. Courses would be available to teach a skill or trade..
they bring in thousands of illegals, give them most of the jobs that are left, give them free healthcare and food stamps, in the meantime cut the American citizens food stamps, great plan by the clintons.......................
Won't last. Once the "single mother" pressures start, it will be forgotten. Nice try though.
I do not want anyone's children or the elderly to go hungry .... But just days ago I stood in line at a grocery store while a fit & trim young couple with expensive haircuts & wearing Nike & Uggs clothing filled a cart with the most expensive gourmet foods, Talenti ice cream, soda pop, steak & cookies ( no cheese eggs chicken vegetables or milk) & paid over $100 with an EBT ( food stamps card)! On my dime as a taxpayer. I have been working since 1965. I used food stamps once for 3 months to feed my child while I looked for a new job in 1971. But it had limits & you could not buy frivolous junk food. Too many of the current EBT users are able bodied spoiled people who could & should pay their own way. I think we need better screening and their should be a limited list of what they can purchase with EBT cards. Fruit vegetables beans eggs & milk etc. From a nurse in Oregon.
Nurse, I had the same experience many years ago. The expensively dressed woman in front of me had a buggy full of steaks, pork chops, roasts, and premium ice cream, and she paid with "food stamps." I was a teacher and my husband was employed by a bank. I was buying ground beef for casseroles and "ice milk" (remember that?) for my two-year-old's birthday party. I witness this much more often now. Since Obama claims unemployment is so low now, why can't counties and states partner with businesses to trade EBT cards for temporary work or day jobs, or something on that order? It's gotten ridiculous.
I am a current recipient of food stamps. I agree that people who are able to work should work while on public assistance. I think we need to fix our economy first though. I have been unemployed for the past 9 years. I have applied to thousands of jobs over the past 9 years and still have nothing to show for it. Out of the thousands of jobs I have applied for, I have only been called in for an interview half a dozen times. I have a bachelors degree and yet no one will hire me!
Do volunteer work. If you do a good job and let people know that you are looking for a job, you will get a job offer from one of the business owners that are supporting that charity. Another approach is to get work as a temporary through a "temp" agency. Many "temps" do a good job and are offered regular employment at a company that uses temp agencies. If you follow either of these paths, work hard and get along with your fellow workers, you will get regular employment.
I wish you luck in the future. You strike me as someone who does not want to be on food stamps. That is not always the case with many welfare recipients.
Keep in mind that one of the largest block receivers of food stamps are people who work for WalMart. Full time!
Absolutely. Whether they have children or not! Plenty of people with children work to buy their food, so why should not the ones getting food for "free" have to work for it! And those in public housing, getting free electricity, cell phones, etc. should also have to work. If nothing else, there is plenty of litter along the highways to pick up.
I was on welfare and incapable of working at one time but signed up for a few hours volunteer work a couple of times a week. It made me feel that I 'gave back' as much as I was capable, and that I was actually still engaged with life, with people, that I could offer something needed, even as I was in need. I was very appreciate of having the help available until I could get back on my feet but a 'welfare life' deforms your spirit, if its not already deformed enough to find that life acceptable. The essentials of power, transport, etc are so expensive, and the knockbacks so demoralising and the eventual inertia so debilitating, that sometimes you sink into despondency. If eligable welfare recipients were matched up with something they could align to personally ( I worked at a farm and an emergency relief food outlet , both which I liked), i could see it working for all concerned. Unfortunately, I could see this becoming an almost work-for - the-state situation and taken to its end-point, that gives me the heebie jeebies.
and your experience is exactly what welfare should be. Temporary, empowering. it is depressing being unemployed. working those hours not only give back to the economy, they do wonders for your self esteem and help you back into the work force. these free loaders that use welfare as a way of life as they work under the table are the real problem, and under obama it seems that the handouts have gotten out of control. turning into a welfare state.
I don't agree and I don't believe you.
I personally know people who get $800+ in food stamps claiming children who do not live with them. They sell them for cash drugs liquor and cigarettes. They sleep all day and party all night. Then their are those who are actually trying to get ahead that are denied any benefits or less than $100 a month help and working 2 to 3 jobs. Need better screening and follow up inspections.
If you have children that are school age, recipients can still work a bit or volunteer.
The LOVE on this site for Jesus is overwhelming. All this we should help the poor get back on their feet, how we should feed them like Jesus fed five thousand. How Jesus Christ nailed to the cross, asked his father to forgive those for they know no better. Yea. There's a lot of love here.
um... more of an economic and policy discussion than a jesus discussion. :)
Novelist, I don't believe that Jesus would agree that able-bodied people should be allowed to steal from others rather than work. We are NOT talking about those who truly need help. Most of us would gladly help those who truly need it.
Holt @Novelist56 Maybe you should read Second Thessalonians 3:10.
most people seem to forget that food stamps are a gift,other people have to work harder to allow the state to give them...and why is anybody on food stamps obese,this is a slap in the face to any tax payer.
Gee Mr Obvious...I never made the connection...you're a lifesaver!
Food stamps can not buy booze or cigarettes or lottery tickets so the recipients are allowed to get cash back to purchase those items in Obama's Name of course
Or the scammers illegally try to sell them. In CA they are good at fast food restaurants.
Most sell them to other fambly that pay 50 cents on a dollar. That money is then used for weed and 24's
wrong it is all on e.b.t cards & I have read stories where they are used at casinos !
Good. If I have to work for money and food then so should the leeches of society. Food stamps should really be eliminated totally. Then you'll see unemployment truly drop. If you have kids you can't afford, have no family or friends for help, and need the government to survive, you made poor choices and deserve to live with the consequences.
There are those too disabled to work due to health conditions in which they are born. Should they be punished by only allowing extremely low income and no way of support?? Especially when family isn't around and they can't afford a home because they can't work?? No caregiver because they don't own a home? Even when they try and try again to get a job only to be stunted because they're sickness won't allow them to be "reliable" even if they're trying they're hardest?? There are always exceptions to the rule.
The story PLAINLY STATED that those who are DISABLED ARE EXEMPT.
Unfortunately being too fat from eating like a pig is considered a disability,especially in the black community. I have never seen a skinny person using an EBT card. Not saying skinny ones don't exist,I just have never seen one.
there are always bullets !
We should have picked our own da*n cotton.
my dad did for $1/100 lb sack
Maybe the politicians shouldn't be paid or even allowed to run for another term until the un employed/under employed are taken care of.
Ahead of the "illegals"?
Another attack on Americas poor-> middle class. We need to overall the program but in a positive way requiring recipients complete food and health educational classes monthly to retain benefits while limiting what can be purchased. This program literally costs tax payers 1/10 a penny per year to fund yet provides many with food who need healthy options. It should be about changing bad habits and inter-generational adverse health conditions so that our health care costs go down due to people becoming more healthy.
Wow you are really misinformed
You, like them, are misconceived.
Give a man a fish, he eats for a day; teach him how to fish, he eats for a lifetime. Even the Bible says so - YOU MUST WORK TO EAT.
The Bible also says to help the poor.
and to stone the children that talk back... so....
Liberals are leaches........
BLM is a terrorist organization funded by the left. As a prominent member of the left Alan, you should know this. So call all your Jewish friends like Soros and tell them to stop sending the checks. Good luck with that.
There is a mistake in reporting right off the bat in this article: "BLM which has done so much good in raising awareness of police abuses..." SERIOUSLY? They became active with the JUSTIFIED officer shooting of Mike Brown. And since then every police shooting which they have used as excuses to riot, with the possible exception of 2 or 3, have been found to be JUSTIFIED. And the officers in those UNJUSTIFIED shootings have been convicted. Contrary to your statement, BLM has done tremendous damage to this country in numerous ways. A large segment of Blacks now believe it is socially acceptable to be openly racist, hostile, and aggressive towards random White people, while attacks and assaults on White elderly and helpless people is openly celebrated.
OK i can fix this= all employers fire the ones who dont show up for work,ON THE DAY OF PROTEST =UH OH MISTAKE 96% OF THEM DONT WORK=WELAFAREHEATHCARE= FOODCARE=HOUSINGCARE=
BLM is a terrorist /hate group trying to masquerade as a help group for black america but their affiliations are questionable at best. SOROS is one of their major donors and that in itself should be enough to make them suspect.
Cicero Afro-Americans had better go to Africa to stand by their brothers there and to improve them in every field of human knowledge. Only in such a way Africans could progress. By themselves are not able. They look like as if they would be paralysed and deranged.
FBLM.
The racism in Israel against blacks, most noticeably Ethiopian Jews, is a travesty but it is no worse than any racial identity that is newly integrated into a society for all of human history. It certainly is not supported by any judicial or legislative body - as unfortunate as this is, it's on humanity as a species more than on Israel as a nation. Israel's treatment of it's Arab citizens on the other hand.... Still, the term genocide DOES NOT apply to any of this and is not a term that should be used lightly.
However the Palestinkian charter calls for the total elimination of the Jewish State (from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea) and genocide of Jews.
Cicero Black lives of peaceful citizens matter but black lives of bandits, villain , hooligans do count for nothing. They do not matter at all and police acts properly blowing them out.
Cicero Black lives of murderers, criminals and rioters do not matter.
Please google "Racism against Africans in Israel". Israel police are slaughtering Blacks. Few know this, not even Black Lives Matter and most American Jews.
But reverse racism is alive and well among BLM. Folks like you attacking Jews just cause they are Jews, and because of your jealousy. But self hatred is alive with BLM, burning down your own businesses and a gas station, no doubt owned by Muslims..
There is racism in Israel like in every other country, but more reasonable that less... When the question of racism against Ethiopian Jews was raised, Israel proved its ability to fight it with the most effective and vigorous ways. I bet this problem will be solved before you will be capable to determine your self autonomously, and not in identification with your anti-semitic hate.
But BLM being anti-white, anti-police, anti-truth, anti-civilized, anti-peace, anti-common sense is just fine eh? We tolerate all that but draw the line at the Jews? It's time for equal treatment.
Black Lives Matter is funded by George Soros, who has worked to eliminate Israel for decades. They'll do anything for his money.
Long live the Jewish State of Israel, with all the land it needs to be safe and secure and with its original, ancient, eternal, and undivided blessed capital city of Jerusalem.
Not to get into a huge debate; but if there were any descendants of the people of Jericho - I wonder how they would feel about Israel's 'historic claim' to the land. According the bible; the ancient Hebrews slaughtered them wholesale so I guess its a moot point.
Israel has as much right to the land that it sits on as America has or any other nation has to the lands that they sit on.
"As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God's work--which is by faith." "It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel." "For they are not all Israel which are of Israel; neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children… but the children of promise are counted for the seed."
Where does Obama stand re: BLM and Israel?
Is there anything Alan does not have an opinion about?
BLM is a Hate group Given Birth by Obama's comments That put a target on the backs of police officers
Black causes have become a played out joke........Sometimes it's a stereotype for a reason.
Of course BLM hates Israel, they're a terrorist organization.
Yes, BLM is a terrorist organization.
The opinion of this person was invalidated in the first sentence, "which has done so much good in raising awareness of police abuses" . "So much good" are you kidding me? So much good at perpetuating racism, and conflict. Blocking roads and rioting and threatening people? Good? Tell ya what, if BLM wants my support, it needs to just go away. I support that. And of course, why Fox reprinted this crap from the boston globe is beyond me.
Hey, pass a law against cell phone videos and you will get your wish for this all to go away.
If not for cell phones and body cams more cops might be unfairly out of a job or worse.
Why was it reprinted? Consider it a clue to the 'group' who controls the media.
Dershowitz erred when he thought that Black Lives Matter was really dedicated to rooting out police abuses. Their goal was always attacks on whites, especially white cops, whether or not they abused blacks. They are a hate group. Eventually, hate groups get around to hating Jews.
Its amazing how angry people get when they keep getting shot.
Who funds BLM? Follow the money!
I do not believe for one moment that police abuse black people. This lie has been repeated so much by politicians and media that it is now accepted as a fact. It is a lie! It is propaganda! This lie has created a dangerous situation that actually "encourages" Blacks to behave badly and not be held accountable for their actions. Police exist to protect and defend law-abiding citizens. Believe it or not, that sometimes requires them to fire their weapon to stop criminal maniacs who violently refuse to follow instructions to stand down and stop threatening harm either to the police, innocent citizens, property, or themselves. Blacks do not die more often than whites at the hands of law enforcement; that's a fact that has been proven.
WELL SEE YOU ANSWERED YOUR OWN STATEMENT. "NO DECENT PERSON" NOT DECENT PERSONS MAKE UP ABOUT 95% OF THE SCUMBAGS IN THE BLM.
If fear, riot, murder, racism and violence is in the repertoire of BLM, why is it not listed as a terrorist group? Why are its members not on the 'no fly' list? Why not pull any subsidies, scholarships, professional licenses, driving licenses or civil/military occupations from its member's hands?
Black Live Matter was just being sarcastic.
Amen and Amen.
BLACK OLIVES MATTER
So these thugs are anti-semites. Gee, who would have guessed it.
Why would Blacks support Israel? That's not even logical.
Huh? Maybe because Jews have been even more pressed than blacks. Maybe because of a shared history of slavery. Maybe because American Jews were in the forefront of the civil rights movement. Maybe because Israel is the only democratic, law based country in the entire middle east.
Like all good Americans, Dershowitz is deeply concerned when people attack Israel, a sure sign of anti-Semitism – or so he tells us. As a distinguished civil rights attorney, Dershowitz helped defend O J Simpson but he isn’t defending BLM when they have the audacity to go after Israel. And like all Americans nowadays, Dershowitz closely identifies with his chosen group of American born Israelis, BLM identifies with their chosen group of African Americans – if you’re a loyal American you must enlist in a group which despises other groups. Is this a great country or what?
"But singling Israel out and falsely accusing it of “genocide” can be explained in no other way than blatant hatred of Jews and their state." ROFL they send tanks roll over the bodies of new born babies, and it's not a genocide? (seen during the last incursion of Israel on europeanTV) take an aspirin dude and get the facts.
Just mowing down future terrorist , Keep it up Israel !
I may have misunderstood your comment to be supportive of Palestinians, re read and realized I misunderstood. My other comment is for those who support Palestinians
Anybody keeping score? Is every interest group now in conflict with at least one other group?
most BLM members or wanna be BLM members are Muslims anyway. Or worse liberals!!
The whole problem is all about racism and hate and you sir are obviously part of the problem! Just like savior Trump, you are very good at placing labels and placing blame, because YOU are part of the problem as well!
Jaxtown, BLM is all about hate. And, to boot, they're dopes for calling out Israel. No other ethnic group has supported Black civil rights & freedom more than the Jewish people. I'm not Jewish but I can clearly see that.
BLM is doing exactly what accuses others of doing. Hypocritical and disgraceful.
BLM is doing exactly what accuses others of doing. Hypocritical and disgraceful.
Blacks in America are the fast growing population of anti-Semites in the US. Yes you can fact check it.
Black Lives Matter movement has been racist from the "Get go". Racial hatred of Whites and White Cops is wide spread and well known everywhere where Black Lives Matter meet. The members belief that Blacks are being murdered by Cops at a unusually high rate is a false narrative. White people are killed far more by Cops. All Lives Matter! It comes as no surprise that some members hate Jews and Israel too. Just shows that fact that racism and racial hatred is very much alive in the Black Lives Matter movement. People should give the Black Lives Matter movement a double thumbs down and show your displeasure of them.
The terrorist nation of Israel illegally occupies large swaths of the West Bank in direct defiance of International law. Israel should only be approximately 1/3 of the size of what it currently occupies, this means 2/3 of their land is illegally occupied, which is a crime against humanity. Israel somehow managaes to have a worse record for crimes against humanity than even abhorrent places like Iran and Syria. Look it up the information is out there and none of it involves conspiracy nut jobs like Alex Jones.
There is no international law against Israel holding the lands they captured in a defensive war. And your claim of a 'worse HR record' than the Arab despots is sheer nonsense. To think that people who can read and write can actually believe anything you've said is beyond comprehension.
Perhaps so but the history of non-Jewish Semites, Muslims, Babylonians (Nebuchadnezzar) and assorted Middle Eastern tribes murdering Jews is long and bloody. But Israel is loyal only to those who defend Jewish interests (Cyrus the Great, a Persian) and violently opposed to those who don’t. Naturally, Israel has a strict immigration policy regarding Palestinians, Israel even built one of those hated Border Walls to keep their nation secure. Is Trump a Jewish name?
Palestinkians have an even stricter policy against Jews. The Palestinkian charter calls for the total elimination of the Jewish state and the genocide of Jews.
Just like any other country we defend our interests and are loyal to those who support and defend our interests until this traitor-in-chief now occupying the White House.
Blah blah blah. Israel is the only civilized nation in the region to keep the unwashed masses at bay.
take that up with the UN, or Israel, keep all your self described righteous anger and hate in the Strip.
I think they should go back to the 6 Day War boarders. Isn't that how most countries gained land through war?
disagree. They would not have that land if the other countries had not invaded first. Why does Israel have to give back land won during an invasion of their country? The United States is not being forced to give land back to England, France, Spain or Mexico
Israel SHOULD be 10X the size to wipe terrorist muslims off the face of the earth.
Uhh am i confusec because Israel was thwre first and has been attacked basically everyday since it was formed. What would you say if Mexico said we want our land back and started shooting rockets at us. Wonder how you would react if somebody you lived was knife to death because of who they were bet you would be singing a different tune. Its a dog eat dog world outside of your safe zone this is how it works yiu attack us we crush you and then take your land so you cant do it again
Everything you just said is factually wrong. Go back in your hole!
That woman is an evil pos
It's too bad Charles Manson is no longer single; she's a good match.
Man...That is one Goofball Looney Liberal...Probably worked with Barry as a Community Organizer in Chicongo...
Racism exists everywhere, even in the mouth of an alligator.
what a efen loon, but most femanazis are.
ALL of them are.
Why would anyone with more than two brain cells follow such a feminist loon? What she says isn't news. It should be privileged information -- notes in her psychiatrist's notebook at the asylum.
Sorry Charlie - alligators want kids that taste good not the parents that have good taste (or sense).
This is the face of the so-called "progressive" movement.
ug..ug..ly.
This is why the surgeon general states that smoking or drinking while pregnant is bad for an unborn child......this is what we get...brain damaged children.....I love how we now turn "accidents" into political social movements.....An accident is an undesirable incidental and unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized
Remember -- spay or neuter your millennials.
I'm sorry, but isn't this woman white? Let's face it, it's cool to to have an issue with white people. She is SO cool. I bet she just can't believe how utterly cool and accepted in all her social circles she really is. So it's not "white privilage" that needs to be stamped out . . .it's "white I wanna be cool".
Seems like she has more of a problem with "white I wanna be dead".
Feminism: When equality just isn't good enough for you anymore.
DEMS are such clueless and useless animals.
But please, you're insulting animals.
When the black child fell into the gorilla cage ... and the gorilla was shot to save the boy ... many people signed a petition to have the mom prosecuted for failing to watch her child. Here an alligator eats a white child ... and there are signs everywhere telling people not to go in the water ... but there are no petitions being signed asking for the boy's dad to be prosecuted. That's the issue .... black people should be condemned ... white people are "privileged" and get a pass and sympathy. For those of you pretending it is otherwise... oh well, you can always be part of the problem instead of part of the solution.
Karvictho; first off the boy didn't "fall" into the Gorilla area - he CLIMBED in! Second, he told his Momma he wanted to go in prior to escaping into the pit! And both Mom and Dad were right next to him but were distracted taking photos! Third off, various stories as to if the Dad was there or not, but he was there. So that boy had 2 parents and 2 siblings old enough to watch over him but ALL were too occupied on Social media to bother watching this lil boy that had to.d his parents that he wanted to climb in!! These deaths have NOTHING at all do with Racism, nor "White Privileges"!! Grow up! Pull up your pants, stop looting your hood and then blah the about not having anything good in your neighborhood! Oh, and BTW, they too could have gone to Disney and gotten their kid eaten by a Gator! They take Food Stamps there ya know!!
The sign said no swimming and BTW all black people do not live in the hood and there are 45.2% of White Privileged, victims on welfare vs 25.7% of Black hood living, drug selling thugs according to the US Department of Agricultural 2015 report ijs
Please tell me if I I'm getting this right: the US Department of Agriculture states that 45.2% of welfare recipients are "white privilege victims?"
I kind of think you fail to see the real picture: Black child is alive while the white child is dead. This is not racial, it is about life and death.
I take it you're femme_esq?
deiw @karvictho you are a part of the problem
People like YOU are the problem!
Maybe the family in Florida got more sympathy because their child was killed. I agree that the Chicago family was unnecessarily maligned.
There are many people who are mad at the white parents. They shrugged off the sign and decided to go into the water. The water could have had bacteria or amebas or some other danger. The gorilla enclosure was a clear hazard, and as every parent knows kids are quick.
If you wish to start a petition to go after them for reckless endangerment. I'm in! However, fighting an alligator with your bare hands as your son is being dragged under by a large animal might be enough. Same with being helpless to fend off a large gorilla as your son is dragged around. The gorilla lawsuit went nowhere because it was an accident. Wait, didn't both families get go fund me pages
Maybe, it was a bunch of people mad that a rare gorilla was shot, and people could care less about a gator. I guess everything I see isn't about race. Conformation bias is something we all should learn about.
It is otherwise: you live in a fantasy world. The problem is people like you and Ms Snarth, the current President, the "reverends" (Al and Jesse), every liberal-socialist, etc. etc. who think that everything is about "phobia", "hate" and "race". Because of the first amendment, your ability to spout the foul libelous statements and baseless accusations is protected. Because of the first amendment, you're going to have to learn to let those who disagree with you continue to disagree. Tragedies happen. Sometimes by our own inattention, and sometimes with no warning or ability to prevent them. When no crime is committed, then those involved in the tragedy should be left alone to grieve.
Considering the fact that I'll never be black, I suppose I'll have to settle for being part of the solution.
However, it is YOU that is "part of the problem" (in fact, a very LARGE part of the problem)... carrying and spreading your venomous hatred of the human race, and especially "whites. And it would indeed be for the same tragedy that befell this little "white" boy to befall YOU, that would be a much to be desired (and quite poetic) "part of the solution".
someone needs a brain transplant!
I believe all of her organs could be of better use to others in need.
Who would want them?
Far better a brain removal... the ISIS way.
Dumber than a box of rocks racist and it is an insult to the box of rocks to use them as a comparison.
INDEED
this nut job married a Givonna Long, google this name to see what a prize she married
How do you know this? Then she would be the "Olivia St. Clair" part?
When does it become ok to take the trash like this out
Chicago, Lawyer, Liberal.................the Gator would have gotten diarrhea or spat her out. JMO
Talk about "Racist!
Hey liberals are you watching this? One of your own spewing venom toward an innocent little 2 year old. Makes some of you proud, I'm sure. With hatred like this circulating on the internet it's little wonder we, as a nation, have lost our moral compass.
I'm also curious. Why would the dad allow the child any where near the water that said "No Swimming". Forget about the bottom of the water having some type problem. It was Florida. Gators can asset water in families pools. So there in open land when that sign would have made any parent more cautious. That Gator laid in wait for that innocent little boy and did what an Alligator known to do. Strike very fast and drag under water. So sad for the family, that I am. The Father will never ever forgive himself. So I really don't think pointing fingers really makes a different at this point. He was the one at the time walking with his Son and that very sad tragic thing happen and that will always be his final remembrance of his child. So heart breaking.
and yet here you are doing just that pointing fingers
Technically they were in compliance with the signs as neither one was swimming. There are thousands of places around the gulf coast that say no swimming and like these signs they are permanent. Sometimes it's as simple as tree stumps being removed to make, as in this case, a man made lake. The owners don't want people hurt on the remaining stumps until they have rotted away. They walked together on a beach and the little boy was in less than 12" of water. Now if the signs that were posted would have said "DANGER ALLIGATORS IN WATER" I could see how you might have a point. However, you do not.
Neither does she seem to have a brain, a heart or a soul. Check out the profile photo. Yeah, some "Honeyblonde", huh? SMH
seriously? Now I live in the South and if there is a public area that has ALLIGATORS we post signs that state that....Now if I am going to "Disney" I would NOT expect at a resort type hotel for there to be Gators and if there are they should POST that because someone from some Northern state on vacation is not thinking Gators unless they are at Animal Kingdom.....this is clearly the fault of the hotel not the parents....and it was an accident:An accident is an undesirable incidental and unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized
American feminists are about as useful as soundless Velcro. Grew up with daddy issues no doubt.
When daddy leaves mommy and kids, kids get daddy issues. It's traumatic for everyone!
So discriminating alligators chose their victims because they taste good or because they have good taste?
Apparently because of this white privilege deal...:/
We really should sue the alligator for not complying with Florida and Federal EEOC (Equal Eating Opportunity Commission) rules as well as Affirmative Action and Diversity requirements. Wrong "race" (actually ethnicity, there is only one race), wrong gender, wrong education and income profile.
sight to make eyes sore, could be a Hilary intern
I'd still rather take my chances at Disney rather than on the streets of Chicago, especially on weekends.
You have better odds with the alligators. The stats are up to 1847 shot. Probably be over 1900 after the weekend.
Anyone wonder why this country and world is in such a mess. My condolences to the family.
With so much evidence being piled higher and higher every day, I quit wondering long ago.
Huh?
right?
Brienne of Snarth Uncovered: Olivia St. Clair Long, aka Brienne of Snarth is an attorney who is employed by a Law Firm in Chicago, IL. A little digging on the internet reveals this woman's Hatred towards "white privilege men" This is a ugly example of a misguided human being... if I ever saw one, but nonetheless a stinking POS! Do a little digging and you will find some of the pieces that makes this woman tick. Check out who she is married to!
nah, she's not worth another moment of my time.
Then again you can ask her "How does a 2 year old get far enough away from the parent and close enough to get snatched by an alligator unsupervised in a huge public arena?" Bad parenting maybe? Just asking, either way it is very sad.
BanGee, how does one become so full of hate like you?
I see you know zip about gators.
Or anything else worth knowing.
Most people don't think about alligators in the pond when they are vacationing at Disney. I wonder why they didn't post a warning sign?
She may be influential but so is the devil.
Disgusting! The women appears to have some "issues" going on. Peace.
She's right. He should feel the guilt for the rest of his life for ignoiring signs. But millions of dollars will buy a couple of four wheelers and some personal watercraft. That'll help him squash the feelings.
You can't go out killing American wildlife ...that's poaching. Or are you commenting on the way $$$ soothe the parent's feelings after a lawsuit?
What an ignorant POS.
White privilege? Getting killed by a gator is a privilege? Paying ridiculous taxes to support kneegrows is a privilege?
Stain.
There is always a mentally disturbed feminist - man hater in the crowd. Put her on the no-fly list.
Actually she should be put on the next available "flight" fly list, out of the country... maybe to a place with an all black population, like the Congo! Oh wait, are they black... I don't see color, I see people, maybe she should try it.
Yes, send her to ISIS she can tell them all about how lousy this country is.
Must be a Hillary Supporter.
That's a given.
LET'S SEE PEOPLE ARE FEED UP WITH RACISM as an excuse for black failure so now black failure is blamed on white privilege. I would laugh if it wasn't so lame.
What a witch!!
This woman is a waste of otherwise perfectly viable skin cells.
What a sick twisted mind she has. I make some bomb thrower comments- but about dead children? She needs help.
Feminism is a disease . An absence of God, loving or caring , for one thing .
Oh Bulls**t. I'm a feminist and nothing like this witch. Feminism is about equality in the workplace and not being treated like second class citizens. Shows how much you know. God has nothing to do with it.
Doesn't the hildabeeste bare a strange resemblance to an alligator?
That's an insult to alligators!
Liberalism is an illness of spirit...leading to nonsensical rationalizations of mind. Liberals rewrite the past.... lie about the present..... and offer nothing for the future....
Well said!
There is a reason they say liberalism is a disease.
don't give it that credit, they will want rational people to pay their therapy bills.
Well, we pay for everything else they want--don't we?
if it was an illegal mexican would she have wrong that ?
im guessing she is a clinton supporter
Brienne of Snarth, I want to share my white male privilege [large alligator] with you.
Hope she feels better
When you're a single-issue hammer, everything looks like a nail. When you're a feminist, everything looks like white male privilege.
What a surprise!!!! Another ugly, self-proclaimed "feminist". After 30 years of observation, I'm thinking being ugly is a requirement.
She should become one with an alligator !
My sympathy to the gator!
RE: ET's contacting earth in 1500 years.. yeah... hope they don't like slaves or human flesh... we must be the wisest beings in existence... to send out constant radio waves, deep space launches, which tell any one and everyone what our tech is and many of our weakness's, so smart to send up a beacon so any and all pirate ET's will know where we are.. Genius !! I'm sure our descendants 1501 years from now will be so thankful for our lack of forethought as they are being led off to the giant meat grinder.
It's a COOKBOOK!
FL protects alligators too much, alligators are serial killers, they eat anything anyone any pet, they can. Sad the media has convinced the public that these killers should be "protected by law"? Hope they learn why some creatures are not desirable neighbors? They should all be re-located to the Everglades (the gators and the media, lol), that would help their tourism and make the rest of FL safer. Same for the Bear issues, Over Development destroys the Bears natural habitat so they have to search for food more and farther, so its mans doing; just Re-Locate them to the Rockies perhaps, that would not require the Bears killed,who are only looking for food most all the times. Too, Disney should have 2 barriers between any dangerous animal or creature and the public. Even a good parent can be caught unawares. Its just human nature to not always be 100% on guard.
Give it up, Alligators were there first. I don't want to see any species wiped out.
White privilege...Pull your pants up and go to work so your taxes can pay the way for those that won't work. Some privilege.
I blame George Bush for I inherited Alligators from the previous Republican administration. If the father had a AR-15 do you think the Alligator would have still taken the boy?
I don't think an AR has sufficient power to take out an alligator. I would suggest a .357
Yep this wonderful President build this new closer than ever country. I listen to these blacks and see how the MAJORITY act and I have to tell you I'm surprised we have not already had a complete race war, but hey the summer has just started and it's suppose to be a scorcher.
OLIVIA ST. CLAIR LONG, aka Brienne of Snarth is an attorney who is employed by Strauss & Malk LLP Chicago, IL. OLIVIA ST. CLAIR is a white female who recently married GIVONNA LONG a black female who also is an attorney and she is employed at a different law firm in the Chicago area. A little snooping on the web will shed some light on the issue of Brienne of Snarth hatred towards white males and her outrage towards "white privilege". Just a lost and twisted POS who probably grew up fatherless in a single parent home and now hates white men?
Thank you for that info.
Just another nobody, a complete nothing.
They're animals anyway so let them lose their souls
I see you also enjoyed the book The Godfather!
Black people are far more racist than white people! And to make it worse the liberals of this country use them and help them be even more racist!
The father of the boy snatched by the gator is 1/2 black...duh Brienne
Top half or bottom half......size matters.... Ask MS Obama, she unfortunately got the top half!
This is clearly a racist comment, but since it is directed towards white men it is ok to print. I believe in Christ, but I am starting to believe some humans have evolved from primates
What do you mean evolved? They stillare primates....
Actually evolutionists are backing away from natural "evolving" and leaning towards selective breeding.
Hey Brienne I am Proud as Ever to be White Man. Does that make me racist ?
I watch NASCAR and INDY, guess that makes me a race-ist
Hey Brianne - get in the kitchen and make me a samich. Chop Chop
ROFLMAO!!!! I just laughed so hard that I sprayed my keyboard with coffee. I was having a really crappy day, and then I read your post. Thank you for putting a smile on my face!!!
That stuff is funny dont care who ya are
White guilt is strong with grubers. HA HA
I'm sure its getting some weird satisfaction in the attention this is garnering it. Maybe its parents ignored it. whatever, it's a creepy thing to say and speaks volumes about its own lack of intelligence, character and compassion. I feel sorry for it actually.
In nature, it's parents would have killed it.
Her parents didn't have ANY kids that lived....
What does the thing think about the little black boy that got into the gorilla cage??? Black privilege?
She supported the gorilla.
This is what we're up against. Good to know our enemy. Only a small step from thinking like this to gas chambers.
Feminist my foot, this person is a man. Not much of one but a man nevertheless. I don't know what his end game is but he's off his rocker.
The good news is that she won't be breeding...we hope.
Methuen Feminism is cancer
I do not pay attention to anybody who uses "Anonymity" to cover their cowardly remarks. If you are going to blast somebody, use your name and Man/Girl up. Don't hide in Mommy's basement.
so synical5 is your given name...
“Brienne of Snarth”, have the courage to crawl out from under the cess ridden rock you slither beneath and I promise you, I will show you what "white privilege" IS all about..............
There are others who stand with you, beside you, and as Soldiers, in Front Of You, against such social anarchary. People who would start up such hatred will destroy this country if allowed to, and Our Oath will not permit that. Now or ever...
Can't Understand Normal Thinking
Nice play on the acronym.....
Feminist eat their own, what did u expect?
Too bad here parents didn't consider abortion
I think the parents had a failed abortion--only it's brain was aborted--the body stayed. That's why it's the way it is.
More proof that feminists are no fun. This one's also a racist.
Some people need to be "put down" for the sake of what humanity is left!
Morris A rude, hateful comment from a feminist about the tragic death of a little boy?!! Noooo!!! What a shock.
The woman appears to be living proof that God has a sense of humor.
Someone will dox the snarky Snarth. It's only a matter of time. Then it will be "later, gator" for her. That is, her anonymity will be eaten alive. Then see how brave she is. Compassion is to feminism as food is to stool.
i blame the parents for this childs death putting him in a no swimming area of water when he could ave just went in the main pool where the water is heated instead of the lagoon which was cold
That and $5 will get you a cup of coffee. I blame you. You were not there...it's amazing how people like you always have an opinion and usually it's ill informed and wrong.
The parents were 30 feet away from the child, it was their fault! His opinion isn't ill informed or wrong, it's spot on! You don't leave a 2 year old playing in water!
A gay transgender guy posing as a feminist with skin as white as alabaster and whose occupation is writing in 144 characters is considered influential because like 10,000 like minded white people find her/him/it fascinating....now THAT is white privileged because surely no black man or Hispanic man could ever pull this off U Go Gurl?Boy?It
I thought it was a dude!
Can we help her overcome her white privilege...and toss her to a gator.
I'll bet the gator likes white and dark meat.
I agree...you know, the other thing is this: she is the leader of 11,000 who either woof, or agree, with all of this garbage. Doesn't that make her the founder of a hate group, and all of her followers members of a hate group? Last time I checked, if a white male posted these things and had such a following, certainly this would be considered hate speech, would it not?
That would be unfair to the gator, unlike lions do after eating natives, gators are unable to lick their arises afterwards to get rid of the taste...
Refers to herself as a "Social Justice" activist, and then spouts THIS? WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND would follow this dim-wit?? Nobody, that's who...
10000 nobodys
No, 10000 Loose nuts off their meds!
Just another ugly leftist.
True. Most leftists ,esp female leftists have a violent hatred towards pretty women.Gee, I wonder why?????
First, lets get this straight: a white, gay male pretending to be a feminist "Brienne" making senseless, ignorant statements... and this is considered influential? Yes, lets blame this unfortunate act of natural selection on the pretense of white privilege. Because that makes complete sense, like most emotionally charged, poorly thought-out, shallow liberal ideas. The amount of hate spewed by these spiteful, mentally ill people is clear as crystal... yet so few have the courage to call them out for the fact that they are the only ones "hating" anything, being intolerant of everyone that doesn't agree with their personal point of view.
White privilege ...work all your life to take care of people who dont work ....
